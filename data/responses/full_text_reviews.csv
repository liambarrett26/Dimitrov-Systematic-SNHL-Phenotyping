We also investigated whether the audiogram shape is a prognostic indicator in the management of ISSNHL. A total of 115 inpatients with ISSNHL treated between 2001 and 2010 were analyzed. The data collected included age, sex, duration of hearing loss at the time of treatment, and the presence or absence of tinnitus, vertigo, diabetes, nystagmus, and canal paresis. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the hearing threshold for each frequency on audiograms as variables. A logistic regression model was used for the prognostic analysis. The audiogram shape was classified into four clusters: (1) crossing horizontally pattern of all tones; (2) up-sloping pattern of low-tone loss; (3) deaf pattern; and (4) down-sloping pattern of high-tone loss. The age of the patient, presence of canal paresis, and audiogram shape showed statistically significant relationships with hearing improvement. The audiogram shape based on the cluster analysis demonstrated a significant relationship with hearing improvement in patients with ISSNHL. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying etiology of each audiogram shape.DOI: 10.1177/014556131809700706",Watanabe et al,1,1,1,,1,1,Has all relevant features for inclusion,1,None,1,NA
a novel unsupervised spectral clustering for puretone audiograms towards hearing aid filter bank design and initial configurations,"The current practice of adjusting hearing aids (HA) is tiring and time-consuming for both patients and audiologists. Of hearing-impaired people, 40–50% are not satisfied with their HAs. In addition, good designs of HAs are often avoided since the process of fitting them is exhausting. To improve the fitting process, a machine learning (ML) unsupervised approach is proposed to cluster the pure-tone audiograms (PTA). This work applies the spectral clustering (SP) approach to group audiograms according to their similarity in shape. Different SP approaches are tested for best results and these approaches were evaluated by Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin criteria values. Kutools for Excel add-in is used to generate audiograms’ population, annotated using the results from SP, and different criteria values are used to evaluate population clusters. Finally, these clusters are mapped to a standard set of audiograms used in HA characterization. The results indicated that grouping the data in 8 groups or 10 results in ones with high evaluation criteria. The evaluation for population audiograms clusters shows good performance, as it resulted in a Silhouette coefficient >0.5. This work introduces a new concept to classify audiograms using an ML algorithm according to the audiograms’ similarity in shape. © 2021 by the authors.

audiometric phenotypes of noiseinduced hearing loss by datadriven cluster analysis and their relevant characteristics,"784.

The data-driven clustering of subtypes could provide refined characteristics of NIHL, and help identify individuals with typical NIHL at diagnosis. Methods: This cross-sectional study initially recruited 12,218 occupational noise-exposed employees aged 18-60 years from two factories of a shipyard in Eastern China. Of these, 10,307 subjects with no history of otological injurie or disease, family history of hearing loss, or history of ototoxic drug use were eventually enrolled. All these subjects completed health behavior questionnaires, cumulative noise exposure (CNE) measurement, and pure-tone audiometry. We did data-driven cluster analysis (k-means clustering) in subjects with hearing loss audiograms (n = 6,599) consist of two independent datasets (n = 4,461 and n = 2,138). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to analyze the relevant characteristics of subjects with different audiometric phenotypes compared to those subjects with normal hearing audiograms (n = 3,708). Results: A total of 10,307 subjects (9,165 males [88.9%], mean age 34.5 [8.8] years, mean CNE 91.2 [22.7] dB[A]) were included, 3,708 (36.0%) of them had completely normal hearing, the other 6,599 (64.0%) with hearing loss audiograms were clustered into four audiometric phenotypes, which were replicable in two distinct datasets. We named the four clusters as the 4-6 kHz sharp-notched, 4-6 kHz flat-notched, 3-8 kHz notched, and 1-8 kHz notched audiogram. Among them, except for the 4-6 kHz flat-notched audiogram which was not significantly related to NIHL, the other three phenotypes with different relevant characteristics were strongly associated with noise exposure. In particular, the 4-6 kHz sharp-notched audiogram might be a typical subtype of NIHL. Conclusions: By data-driven cluster analysis of the large-scale noise-exposed population, we identified three audiometric phenotypes associated with distinct NIHL subtypes. Data-driven sub-stratification of audiograms might eventually contribute to the precise diagnosis and treatment of NIHL.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Qian, Yang, Shi, Hong, Han, Li, Lin, Huang and Wu.DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2021.662045PMCID: PMC8027076",Wang et al,1,1,1,,3,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.

using cluster analysis to classify audiogram shapes references,"The purpose of this study was to design a statistical classification system of audiogram shapes in order to improve and integrate shape recognition across clinical settings. The study included 1633 adult subjects with normal hearing or symmetric sensorineural hearing impairment who underwent pure-tone audiometry between July 2007 and December 2008. K-means cluster analysis was employed to categorize audiometric shapes. Eleven audiogram shapes were identified: rising, flat, peaked 8-kHz dip, 4-kHz dip, 8-kHz dip, mild sloping, severe 8-kHz dip, sloping, abrupt loss, severe sloping, and profound abrupt loss. By using the classification system and nomenclature identified for audiogram shapes as outlined in this study, errors based on personal experiences can be reduced and a consistency can be developed across clinics.

Audiograms are typically categorized into a few canonical types, each thought to reflect distinct pathologies of the ear. Here, we analyzed 116,400 patient records from our clinic collected over a 24-year period and found that standard categorization left 46% of patient records unclassified. To better account for the full spectrum of hearing loss profiles, we used a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to segment audiograms without any assumptions about frequency relationships, interaural symmetry or etiology. The GMM converged on ten types, featuring varying degrees of high-frequency hearing loss, flat loss, mixed loss, and notched profiles, with predictable relationships to patient age and sex. A separate GMM clustering of 15,380 audiograms from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified six similar types, that only lacked the more extreme hearing loss configurations observed in our patient cohort. Whereas traditional approaches distill hearing loss configurations down to a few canonical types by disregarding much of the underlying variability, an objective probabilistic model that accounted for all of the data identified an organized, but more heterogenous set of audiogram types that was consistent across two large clinical databases.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-63515-5PMCID: PMC7174357",Parthasarathy et al.,1,1,1,,5,1,Meets all inclusion criteria while not violating any exlcusion.,1,None,1,NA
a novel method for classifying hearing impairment in epidemiological studies of aging the wisconsin agerelated hearing impairment classification scale references,"Purpose: Longitudinal population-based cohort data were used to develop a standardized classification system for age-related hearing impairment using thresholds for frequencies (0.5-8 kHz) typically measured in cohort studies. Method: Audiometric testing data collected in the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study from participants (n = 1,369) with four visits (1993-1995, 1998-2000, 2003-2005, and 2009-2010) were included (10,952 audiograms). Cluster analyses (Wald's method) were used to identify audiometric patterns. Maximum allowable threshold values were defined for each cluster to create an ordered scale. Progression was defined as a two-step change. Results: An eight-step scale was developed to capture audiogram shape and severity of hearing impairment. Of the 1,094 participants classified as having normal hearing based on a pure-tone average, only 25% (n = 277) were classified as Level 1 (all thresholds <= 20 dB HL) on the new scale, whereas 17% (n = 182) were Levels 4-6. During the 16-year follow-up, 64.9% of those at Level 1 progressed. There was little regression using this scale. Conclusions: This is the first scale developed from population-based longitudinal cohort data to capture audiogram shape across time. This simple, standardized scale is easy to apply, reduces misclassification of normal hearing, and may be a useful method for identifying risk factors for early, preclinical, age-related changes in hearing.

data mining of audiology patient records factors influencing the choice of hearing aid type,"Background: This paper describes the analysis of a database of over 180,000 patient records, collected from over 23,000 patients, by the hearing aid clinic at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, UK. These records consist of audiograms (graphs of the faintest sounds audible to the patient at six different pitches), categorical data (such as age, gender, diagnosis and hearing aid type) and brief free text notes made by the technicians. This data is mined to determine which factors contribute to the decision to fit a BTE (worn behind the ear) hearing aid as opposed to an ITE (worn in the ear) hearing aid.Methods: From PCA (principal component analysis) four main audiogram types are determined, and are related to the type of hearing aid chosen. The effects of age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and individual audiogram frequencies are combined into a single model by means of logistic regression. Some significant keywords are also discovered in the free text fields by using the chi-squared (χ(2)) test, which can also be used in the model. The final model can act a decision support tool to help decide whether an individual patient should be offered a BTE or an ITE hearing aid.Results: The final model was tested using 5-fold cross validation, and was able to replicate the decisions of audiologists whether to fit an ITE or a BTE hearing aid with precision in the range 0.79 to 0.87.Conclusions: A decision support system was produced to predict the type of hearing aid which should be prescribed, with an explanation facility explaining how that decision was arrived at. This system should prove useful in providing a ""second opinion"" for audiologists.",Anwar & Oakes,1,1,1,,17,2,"Exclude. Not SNHL only and not proper use of clustering.

This study aims to propose a set of standard audiograms representing the Korean population that were derived by analyzing data from the 2009-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), a nationwide epidemiologic study conducted by Korean government organizations. Standard audiograms were derived by applying a hierarchical clustering method from recorded audiologic data that were obtained independently at 6 frequencies for each ear: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kHz (in dB HL). To derive the optimal number of clusters of the desired standard audiograms, cubic clustering criterion, pseudo-F-, and pseudo-t2-statistics were calculated. These analyses resulted in 29 clusters representing a standard audiogram of the South Korean population. Eighteen of the clusters represented normal hearing audiograms (73.11%), while 11 represented hearing-impaired (HI) standard audiograms (27.89%). Of the 11 HI audiograms, 7 were defined as flat-type (17.81%), while the remaining 4 were defined as sloping-type (9.08%). In conclusion, 29 audiograms representing standard audiograms for the Korean population have been derived using KNHANES data. Improved understanding of the characteristics of each cluster may be helpful for development of more personalized, fixed-setting hearing aids.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-40300-7PMCID: PMC6403394",Chang et al.,1,1,1,,20,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.

datadriven approach for auditory profiling and characterization of individual hearing loss,"61.

However, the perceptual consequences of hearing loss are typically associated not only with a loss of sensitivity but also with a loss of clarity that is not captured by the audiogram. A detailed characterization of a hearing loss may be complex and needs to be simplified to efficiently explore the specific compensation needs of the individual listener. Here, it is hypothesized that any listener's hearing profile can be characterized along two dimensions of distortion: Type I and Type II. While Type I can be linked to factors affecting audibility, Type II reflects non-audibility-related distortions. To test this hypothesis, the individual performance data from two previous studies were reanalyzed using an unsupervised-learning technique to identify extreme patterns in the data, thus forming the basis for different auditory profiles. Next, a decision tree was determined to classify the listeners into one of the profiles. The analysis provides evidence for the existence of four profiles in the data. The most significant predictors for profile identification were related to binaural processing, auditory nonlinearity, and speech-in-noise perception. This approach could be valuable for analyzing other data sets to select the most relevant tests for auditory profiling and propose more efficient hearing-deficit compensation strategies.DOI: 10.1177/2331216518807400PMCID: PMC6236853",Sanchez-Lopez et al.,1,1,1,,26,1,Meets all inclusion criteria while not violating any exlcusion.

the implementation of the kmedoid clustering for grouping hearing loss function on excessive smartphone use,"During the current pandemic, smartphones have become a means of learning for all students in Indonesia, including high school students. Students use smartphones to send assignments, learn via video calls, and conduct online exams. The prolonged use of smartphones, from the beginning of learning hours in the morning to study hours in the evening, has a terrible impact on the ear health of high school students in Padang. Excessive smartphone use caused a decrease in the student's hearing function. Therefore, this study aims to group the audiometry results of high school students in Padang who have a hearing loss function. The audiogram result is only performed as the result of a frequency test of the subject's hearing in both the left and right ear. Conventionally, an otolaryngologist concluded the final decision of hearing loss ability. This research proposed an automatic classification of audiometry results using machine learning methods. The K-Medoids clustering was selected to classify the audiometry data in this research. Of 210 audiometry data, 91 data is confirmed by an otolaryngologist as valid data. By using the K-Medoids clustering, 93 data is classified into Normal hearing, Mild Hearing loss, and Moderate Hearing loss. The proposed model successfully grouped the audiometry data into three categories. The confusion matrix is applied to measure the model performance, which has 28,3% accuracy, 64,3% precision, and 21,4% recall. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

a flexible datadriven audiological patient stratification method for deriving auditory profiles,"743.

For this purpose, extensive test batteries have been developed aiming to cover all relevant aspects as defined by experts or model assumptions. However, as the assessment time of physicians is limited, such test batteries are often not used in clinical practice. Instead, fewer measures are used, which vary across clinics. This study aimed at proposing a flexible data-driven approach for characterizing distinct patient groups (patient stratification into auditory profiles) based on one prototypical database (N = 595) containing audiogram data, loudness scaling, speech tests, and anamnesis questions. To further maintain the applicability of the auditory profiles in clinical routine, we built random forest classification models based on a reduced set of audiological measures which are often available in clinics. Different parameterizations regarding binarization strategy, cross-validation procedure, and evaluation metric were compared to determine the optimum classification model. Our data-driven approach, involving model-based clustering, resulted in a set of 13 patient groups, which serve as auditory profiles. The 13 auditory profiles separate patients within certain ranges across audiological measures and are audiologically plausible. Both a normal hearing profile and profiles with varying extents of hearing impairments are defined. Further, a random forest classification model with a combination of a one-vs.-all and one-vs.-one binarization strategy, 10-fold cross-validation, and the kappa evaluation metric was determined as the optimal model. With the selected model, patients can be classified into 12 of the 13 auditory profiles with adequate precision (mean across profiles = 0.9) and sensitivity (mean across profiles = 0.84). The proposed approach, consequently, allows generating of audiologically plausible and interpretable, data-driven clinical auditory profiles, providing an efficient way of characterizing hearing deficits, while maintaining clinical applicability. The method should by design be applicable to all audiological data sets from clinics or research, and in addition be flexible to summarize information across databases by means of profiles, as well as to expand the approach toward aided measurements, fitting parameters, and further information from databases.Copyright © 2022 Saak, Huelsmeier, Kollmeier and Buhl.DOI: 10.3389/fneur.2022.959582PMCID: PMC9520582",Saak et al.,1,1,1,,42,2,Dataset is not reduced to SNHL only.

presbycusis phenotypes form a heterogeneous continuum when ordered by degree and configuration of hearing loss,"372. Hear Res. 2010 Jun 1;264(1-2):10-20. doi: 10.1016/j.heares.2010.02.001. Epub 2010 Feb 6.Presbycusis phenotypes form a heterogeneous continuum when ordered by degree and configuration of hearing loss.Allen PD(1), Eddins DA.Author information:(1)Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. paul_allen@urmc.rochester.eduMany reports have documented age-by-frequency increases in average auditory thresholds in various human populations. Despite this, the prevalence of different patterns of hearing loss in presbycusis remains uncertain. We examined 'presbycusis phenotypes' in a database of 960 subjects (552 female, 408 male, 18-92 years) that each had 30 measures of peripheral hearing sensitivity: pure tone audiograms for left and right ears from 0.25 to 8 kHz and DPOAE for each ear with F(mean)=1-6.4 kHz. Surprisingly, the hearing phenotypes did not naturally separate into discrete classes of presbycusis. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that two principal components account for 74% of the variance among the 30 measures of hearing. The two components represent the overall degree (PC1) and configuration of loss (Flat vs. Sloping; PC2) and the phenotypes form a continuum when plotted against them. A heuristic partitioning of this continuum produced classes of presbycusis that vary in their degree of Sloping or Flat hearing loss, suggesting that the previously reported sub-types of presbycusis arise from the categorical segregation of a continuous and heterogeneous distribution. Further, most phenotypes lie intermediate to the extremes of either Flat or Sloping loss, indicating that if audiometric configuration does predict presbycusis etiology, then a mixed origin is the most prevalent.Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

prevalence of hearing impairment by gender and audiometric configuration results from the national health and nutrition examination surgery 19992004 and the keokuk county rural health study 19941998,"Purpose: This study describes the most common audiometric configurations and the prevalence of these configurations among adults (ages 20 to 69) in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States and in a sample of residents of a rural county in Iowa.Research Design: This was a cross-sectional population-based study.Study Sample: Estimates generalizing to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States were based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected from 2819 women and 2525 men between 1999 and 2004. Estimates from the rural county were based on Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS) data collected from 892 women and 750 men between 1994 and 1998.Data Collection and Analysis: Cluster analyses (k-means) were used to divide participants into groups including maximally similar bilateral air conduction audiograms. Separate cluster analyses were conducted for each gender. For NHANES data, prevalence and error estimates were obtained using sample weights intended to provide data generalizing to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States within this age range.Results: The hierarchical structure of audiometric configurations revealed that approximately 25% of women and 50% of men aged 20 to 69 in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States were best described by a configuration consistent with a marked hearing impairment in at least one frequency. Hearing impairments were more common among participants in the KCRHS. Gently sloping configurations of hearing impairment were dominant among women, while configurations featuring a greater slope were dominant among men. There was a greater variety of audiometric configurations in men than women.Conclusions: In addition to their descriptive value, these data can be used to inform future studies of risk factors and progression of hearing loss, and to improve the generalizability of studies involving rehabilitative options for people with hearing impairment.",Ciletti & Flamme,1,1,1,,64,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.,2,"Only AC, no mention of sensori ",2,Not SNHL only

The aim of this study was to determine if these SNPs are also associated with ARHI in an elderly male Han Chinese population. In this case-control candidate genes association study, a total of 982 men with ARHI and 324 normal-hearing controls subjects were studied. Using K-means cluster analysis, four audiogram shape subtypes of ARHI were identified in the case group: ''flat shape (FL)'', ''sloping shape (SL)'', ''2-4 kHz abrupt loss (AL) shape'' and ''8 kHz dip (8D) shape''. Results suggested that the SNP rs11928865 (A>T) of GRM7 was significantly associated with ARHI after adjusting for non-genetic factors (p = 0.000472, OR = 1.599, 95%CI = 1.229~2.081). Furthermore, frequency of TT genotype (rs11928865) were significant higher in the SL subgroup and AL subgroup with compared to controls group (p = 9.41E-05, OR = 1.945, 95%CI = 1.393~2.715; p = 0.000109, OR = 1.915, 95%CI = 1.378~2.661 adjusted, respectively) after Bonferroni correction.

Results of the current study suggest that, in an elderly male Han Chinese population, GRM7 SNP rs11928865 (TT) occurs more frequently in ARHI patients with SL and AL phenotype patterns.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0077153PMCID: PMC3795658",Luo et al,1,1,1,,135,1,Has all relevant features for inclusion,1,None,1,NA
"Associations Between Age-Related Hearing Loss, Cognitive Impairment, and Multiple Chronic Conditions in a Group Care Setting","Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between hearing loss, cognitive status, and a range of health outcomes over a period of 2 years in a sample of older adults who are enrolled in Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, which is a Medicare/Medicaid beneficiary program for individuals who are nursing home eligible but living in the community at time of enrollment.
 
Method: The sample (N = 144) includes a diverse (47% White/non-Hispanic, 35% Black/African American, and 16% Latin/Hispanic) group of adults ranging from 55 to 93 years old. We used medical chart data to measure respondents' cognitive and health status, including chronic conditions and hospital use. Hearing status was measured once at the beginning of the 2-year review period. We used logistic regression and negative binomial hurdle models for analyses. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to explore the extent to which respondents cluster into a set of ""health profiles"" characterized by their hearing, cognitive status, and health conditions.
 
Results: We found that hearing loss is weakly associated with heart disease and diabetes and associated with cerebrovascular disease and falls; cognitive impairment is also associated with cerebrovascular disease and the number of falls. LCA indicates that respondents cluster into a variety of health profiles with a consistent pairing of hearing loss and depression.
 
Conclusions: The results are largely consistent with associations reported in epidemiological studies that include age-related hearing loss. Of particular interest in this study is the LCA that suggested that all of the profiles associated with a high likelihood of hearing loss included a high risk of depression. The co-occurrence of these two factors highlights the need to identify and treat hearing loss in older adults, especially as part of the treatment plan for individuals with depressive symptoms.",Mamo et al.,1,1,1,Disagreed at stage 1. 3rd reviewer included for full text review (stage 2).,59,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.,2,"Only bc, no mention of SNHL although all patients are old, does not try to find subtypes of hearing loss per se but groups of patients with clusters of pathology including hearing loss severity",2,Not SNHL only
A Machine Learning Based Clustering Protocol for Determining Hearing Aid Initial Configurations from Pure-Tone Audiograms,"Of the nearly 35 million people in the USA who are hearing impaired, only an estimated 25% use hearing aids (HA). A good number of HAs are prescribed but not used partially because of the time to convergence for best operation between the audiologist and user. To improve HA retention, it is suggested that a machine learning (ML) protocol could be established which improves initial HA configurations given a user�s pure-tone audiogram. This study examines a ML clustering method to predict the best initial HA fitting from a corpus of over 90,000 audiogram-fitting pairs collected from hearing centers throughout the USA. We first examine the final HA comfort targets to determine a limited number of preset configurations using several multi-dimensional clustering methods (Birch, Ward, and k-means). The goal is to reduce the amount of adjustments between the centroid, selected as a fitting configuration to represent the cluster, and the final HA configurations. This may be used to reduce the adjustment cycles for HAs or as preset starting configurations for personal sound amplification products (PSAPs). Using various classification methods, audiograms are mapped to a limited number of potential preset configurations. Finally, the average adjustment between the preset fitting targets and the final fitting targets is examined.",Belitz et al.,0,1,1,,NA,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.,2,"only AC, clustering seems to be based on HA setting initially not PTA, no mention of SNHL",2,Not SNHL only
Standard Audiograms for the IEC 60118-15 Measurement Procedure,"For the characterization of hearing aids, a new test method has been defined in the new International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60118-15. For this characterization, the hearing aid will be set to actual user settings as programmed by standard fitting software from the hearing aid manufacturer. To limit the variation of programming outcomes, 10 standard audiograms, which cover the entire range of audiograms met in clinical practice, have been defined. This article describes how the set of standard audiograms has been developed. This set of standard audiogram has been derived by a vector quantization analysis method on a database of 28,244 audiograms. Using this analysis method, sets of typical audiograms have been obtained of sizes 12 and 60. It turned out that the smaller set could not be used for selecting audiograms as sloping audiograms were absent. Therefore, the larger set has been analyzed to provide seven standard audiograms for flat and moderately sloping hearing loss and three standard audiograms for steep hearing loss.",Bisgaard et al.,0,1,1,,NA,2,No BC and so cannot state it is SNHL only.,2,"Elkhouley based on this study - no inclusion of SNHL, AC only",2,Not SNHL only
Robust Data-Driven Auditory Profiling Towards Precision Audiology,"The sources and consequences of a sensorineural hearing loss are diverse. While several approaches have aimed at disentangling the physiological and perceptual consequences of different etiologies, hearing deficit characterization and rehabilitation have been dominated by the results from pure-tone audiometry. Here, we present a novel approach based on data-driven profiling of perceptual auditory deficits that attempts to represent auditory phenomena that are usually hidden by, or entangled with, audibility loss. We hypothesize that the hearing deficits of a given listener, both at hearing threshold and at suprathreshold sound levels, result from two independent types of �auditory distortions.� In this two-dimensional space, four distinct �auditory profiles� can be identified. To test this hypothesis, we gathered a data set consisting of a heterogeneous group of listeners that were evaluated using measures of speech intelligibility, loudness perception, binaural processing abilities, and spectrotemporal resolution. The subsequent analysis revealed that distortion type-I was associated with elevated hearing thresholds at high frequencies and reduced temporal masking release and was significantly correlated with elevated speech reception thresholds in noise. Distortion type-II was associated with low-frequency hearing loss and abnormally steep loudness functions. The auditory profiles represent four robust subpopulations of hearing-impaired listeners that exhibit different degrees of perceptual distortions. The four auditory profiles may provide a valuable basis for improved hearing rehabilitation, for example, through profile-based hearing-aid fitting.",Sanchez-Lopez et al.,0,1,1,,NA,1,Meets all inclusion criteria while not violating any exlcusion.
