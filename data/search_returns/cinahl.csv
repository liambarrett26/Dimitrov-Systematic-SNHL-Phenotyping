This study retrospectively analyzed hearing test results from elderly patients experiencing vertigo and dizziness at ENT outpatient over a 10-year period, in order to study the patterns of hearing loss in this patient population. Methods: Nine thousand three hundred eighty four patients over 50 years old underwent retrospective collection and screening of outpatient diagnosis, pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance measurement (tympanogram) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) test. The patient's audiograms are divided into 7 subtypes according to a set of fixed criteria. Meanwhile, K-Means clustering analysis method was used to classify the audiogram. Results: The Jerger classification of tympanogram in elderly patients with vertigo and dizziness showed the majority falling under type A. The leading audiogram shapes were flat (27.81% in right ear and 26.89% in left ear), high-frequency gently sloping (25.97% in right ear and 27.34% in left ear), and high-frequency steeply sloping (21.60% in right ear and 22.53% in left ear). Meniere's disease (MD; 30.87%), benign recurrent vertigo (BRV; 19.07%), and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; 15.66%) were the most common etiologies in elderly vestibular diseases. We observed statistically significant differences in hearing thresholds among these vestibular diseases (P < 0.001). K-Means clustering analysis suggested that the optimal number of clusters was three, with sample sizes for the three clusters being 2,747, 2,413, and 4,139, respectively. The ANOVA statistical results of each characteristic value showed P < 0.001. Conclusion: The elderly patients often have mild to moderate hearing loss as a concomitant symptom with vertigo. Female patients have better hearing thresholds thanmales. The dominant audiometric shapes in this patient population were flat, high-frequency gently sloping, and high-frequency steeply sloping according to a set of fixed criteria.

Retrospective study There were 206 audiograms included from 206 children with sensorineural hearing loss. Nested cross-validation was used for evaluating the performance of the CA and ML. Six audiogram prediction simulations were performed in which either one or two thresholds across 0.5–4 kHz from complete audiograms in the dataset were labelled. Missing thresholds at the remaining frequencies were then predicted using the CA and ML in each simulation. The accuracy of the ML algorithm was determined by comparing the median average absolute threshold differences between the CA and ML using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The reliability between runs of the ML was also assessed with Cronbach's alphas. The median average absolute threshold differences in ML (5–8 dBHL) were statistically significantly lower than those in CA (6.25–10 dBHL) in all six simulations (p value < 0.05). The ML algorithm was also found to be reliable to predict the audiograms in all six simulations (α > 0.9).

The second subject, after 9 months of manual fitting, had developed good open set word recognition, but his scores remained poor at soft and loud presentation levels. Main outcome measure(s): Cochlear implant fitting parameters, pure tone thresholds, bisyllabic word recognition, phonemic discrimination scores and loudness scaling curves. Results: For subject 1, a first approach trying to optimize the home maps by means of AI-proposed adaptations was not successful whereas a second approach based on the use of Automaps (an AI approach based on universal, i.e. population based group statistics) during 3 months allowed the development of open set word recognition.

However, uptake and usage in this population have historically been reported as low. The aim of this study was to understand the hearing loss characteristics, from measured audiometric hearing loss and self-perceived hearing handicap, that contribute to the decision of hearing aid ownership. A total of 2833 adults aged 50+ years, of which 329 reported hearing aid ownership, were involved with a population-based survey with audiometric hearing assessments. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to classify hearing aid ownership from audiometric measurements and hearing disability outcomes. An overall accuracy of 92.5% was found for the performance of the CART analysis in predicting hearing aid ownership from hearing loss characteristics. By including hearing disability, sensitivity for predicting hearing aid ownership increased by up to 40% compared with just audiometric hearing loss measurements alone. A decision tree approach that considers both objectively measured hearing loss and self-perceived hearing disability, could facilitate a more tailored and personalised approach for determining hearing aid needs in the older population. Without intervention, older adults with hearing loss are at higher risk of cognitive decline and higher rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation. The provision of hearing aids can compensate hearing function, however, uptake and usage have been reported as low.

In non-VSRP conditions, SP was evaluated on 40 Bamford-Kowal-Bench speech-in-noise test (BKB-SIN) sentences presented by the speaker at 50 A-weighted decibels (dBA) with multiperson babble noise presented from 50 to 75 dBA. SP was defined as the percentage of words correctly identified. In VSRP conditions, an infrared camera was used to track 35 points around the speaker's lips during speech in real time. Lip movement data were translated into speech-text via an in-house developed neural network-based VSRP. SP was evaluated similarly in the non-VSRP condition on 42 BKB-SIN sentences, with the addition of the VSRP output presented on a screen to the listener.Results: In high-noise conditions (70-75 dBA) without VSRP, NH listeners achieved significantly higher speech perception than IWHL listeners (38.7% vs 25.0%, P = .02).

Older listeners generally demonstrate poorer suprathreshold auditory processing along with aging-related declines in neurocognitive functioning that may impair their ability to compensate using “top-down” cognitive–linguistic functions. This study explored top-down processing in older and younger adult listeners, specifically the use of semantic context during noise-vocoded sentence recognition. Method: Eighty-four adults with age-normal hearing (45 young normal-hearing [YNH] and 39 older normal-hearing [ONH] adults) participated. Participants were tested for recognition accuracy for two sets of noise-vocoded sentence materials: one that was semantically meaningful and the other that was syntactically appropriate but semantically anomalous. Participants were also tested for hearing ability and for neurocognitive functioning to assess working memory capacity, speed of lexical access, inhibitory control, and nonverbal fluid reasoning, as well as vocabulary knowledge. Results: The ONH and YNH listeners made use of semantic context to a similar extent. Nonverbal reasoning predicted recognition of both meaningful and anomalous sentences, whereas pure-tone average contributed additionally to anomalous sentence recognition. None of the hearing, neurocognitive, or language measures significantly predicted the amount of context gain, computed as the difference score between meaningful and anomalous sentence recognition. However, exploratory cluster analyses demonstrated four listener profiles and suggested that individuals may vary in the strategies used to recognize speech under adverse listening conditions. Conclusions: Older and younger listeners made use of sentence context to similar degrees. Nonverbal reasoning was found to be a contributor to noise-vocoded sentence recognition. However, different listeners may approach the problem of recognizing meaningful speech under adverse conditions using different strategies based on their hearing, neurocognitive, and language profiles. These findings provide support for the complexity of bottom-up and top-down interactions during speech recognition under adverse listening conditions.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=161407159&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,161407159,6,66,1,"Rockville, Maryland",minor,Funding Source,minor,"Hearing Loss, Sensorineural",age,Adolescent: 13-18 years,,,age,Adult: 19-44 years,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,age,Aged: 65+ years,age,"Aged, 80 & over",gender,Male,gender,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: The sample (N = 144) includes a diverse (47% White/non-Hispanic, 35% Black/African American, and 16% Latin/Hispanic) group of adults ranging from 55 to 93 years old. We used medical chart data to measure respondents' cognitive and health status, including chronic conditions and hospital use. Hearing status was measured once at the beginning of the 2-year review period. We used logistic regression and negative binomial hurdle models for analyses. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to explore the extent to which respondents cluster into a set of ""health profiles"" characterized by their hearing, cognitive status, and health conditions. Results: We found that hearing loss is weakly associated with heart disease and diabetes and associated with cerebrovascular disease and falls; cognitive impairment is also associated with cerebrovascular disease and the number of falls. LCA indicates that respondents cluster into a variety of health profiles with a consistent pairing of hearing loss and depression. Conclusions: The results are largely consistent with associations reported in epidemiological studies that include age-related hearing loss. Of particular interest in this study is the LCA that suggested that all of the profiles associated with a high likelihood of hearing loss included a high risk of depression.

Among the preoperative verbal learning and memory measures, repetition learning slope and measures of self-generated organizational clustering strategies were the strongest predictors of post-CI speech recognition outcomes.Conclusions: Older adult CI candidates present with verbal learning and memory deficits compared with older adults without hearing loss, even on visual tasks that are independent from the direct effects of audibility. Preoperative verbal learning and memory processes reflecting repetition learning and self-generated organizational strategies in free recall were associated with speech recognition outcomes 6 months after implantation. The pattern of results suggests that visual measures of verbal learning may be a useful predictor of outcomes in postlingual adult CICs.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=156372625&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,156372625,9,43,3,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM35319518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: Seven different ML techniques, including transparent (i.e., decision tree and logistic regression) and opaque (e.g., random forest) models, were trained and evaluated on a data set including 215 tested ears (99 with hearing loss of mild degree or higher and 116 with no hearing loss). Post hoc explainability techniques were applied to highlight the role of each feature in predicting hearing loss. Results: Random forest (accuracy = .85, sensitivity = .86, specificity = .85, precision = .84) performed, on average, better than decision tree (accuracy = .82, sensitivity = .84, specificity = .80, precision = .79). Support vector machine, logistic regression, and gradient boosting had similar performance as random forest. According to post hoc explainability analysis on models generated using random forest, the features with the highest relevance in predicting hearing loss were age, number and percentage of correct responses, and average reaction time, whereas the total test time had the lowest relevance. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a multivariate approach can help detect hearing loss with satisfactory performance.

This study investigated differences between cochlear implant users and normal-hearing peers in the clustering and time course of word retrieval during phonological and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Method: Twenty-eight children and adolescents (aged 9–17 years) with cochlear implants and 33 normal-hearing peers completed measures of verbal fluency, nonverbal intelligence, speech perception, and verbal short-term/working memory. Phonological and semantic verbal fluency tests were scored for total words generated, words generated in each 10-s interval of the 1-min task, latency to first word generated, number of word clusters, average cluster size, and number of word/cluster switches. Results: Children and adolescents with cochlear implants generated fewer words than normal-hearing peers throughout the entire 60-s time interval of the phonological and semantic fluency tasks. Cochlear implant users also had slower start latency times and produced fewer clusters and switches than normal-hearing peers during the phonological fluency task. Speech perception and verbal working memory scores were more strongly associated with verbal fluency scores in children and adolescents with cochlear implants than in normal-hearing peers. Conclusions: Cochlear implant users show poorer phonological and semantic verbal fluency than normal-hearing peers, and their verbal fluency is significantly associated with speech perception and verbal working memory.

It affects communicative abilities in all age groups. However, it is well known that elderly people suffer more frequently from hearing loss. Two different model approaches were employed: A generalised linear model and a random forest regression model were used to quantify the relationship between pure-tone hearing loss, age, and speech perception. Both models were applied to a large clinical data set of 19,801 ears, covering all degrees of hearing loss. They allow the estimation of age-related decline in speech recognition for different types of audiograms. Our results show that speech scores depend on the specific type of hearing loss and life decade. We found age effects for all degrees of hearing loss. A deterioration in speech recognition of up to 25 percentage points across the whole life span was observed for constant pure-tone thresholds. The largest decrease was 10 percentage points per life decade.

We also address the question of the efficiency of a rhythmic training on temporal adaptation during speech interaction in children with hearing loss. Method: We recorded electroencephalogram data in children while they named pictures delivered on a screen, in alternation with a virtual partner. We manipulated the virtual partner's speech rate (fast vs. slow) and the regularity of alternation (regular vs. irregular). The group of children with normal hearing was tested once, and the group of children with hearing loss was tested twice: once after 30 min of auditory training and once after 30 min of rhythmic training. Results: Both groups of children adjusted their speech rate to that of the virtual partner and were sensitive to the regularity of alternation with a less accurate performance following irregular turns. Moreover, irregular turns elicited a negative event-related potential in both groups, showing a detection of temporal deviancy. Notably, the amplitude of this negative component positively correlated with accuracy in the alternation task. In children with hearing loss, the effect was more pronounced and long-lasting following rhythmic training compared with auditory training.

Results: Cluster analysis revealed three types of hearing loss. The mean hearing loss in cluster 1 (6 cases) was above 30 dB, mainly as the result of perforation after chronic otitis media.

In cluster 2 the perforation was mostly located in the posterior quadrants, while in cluster 3 it was most commonly in the inferior quadrants. In clusters 2 and 3, perforation was usually caused by slap of the open hand, injury, or past ventilation tube.

MMP9 is a proteinase involved in neuroplasticity underlying different clinical conditions in human. Material and methods: This was a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of 61 congenitally deaf children who underwent cochlear implantation. We investigated the genetic variants of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and plasma levels of MMP-9 that have been implicated in neuroplasticity after cochlear implantation. Auditory development was assessed by using the LittlEARS Questionnaire (LEAQ) at three follow-up points and the plasma level of MMP-9 was measured at implantation. Results: There was a significant negative correlation between MMP-9 plasma level at implantation and LEAQ score at 18 months follow-up (p < 0.05). Two clusters of good and poor CI performers could be isolated based on this correlation. The prevalence of genetic variants of MMP9 - rs3918242, rs20544, and rs2234681 - in the good performers cluster was different to their prevalence in the poor performers cluster. Conclusions: The study showed that children born deaf who have an MMP-9 plasma level of less than 150 ng/ml at cochlear implantation have a reasonable chance of attaining a high LEAQ score after 18 months of speech and language rehabilitation. It appears that MMP-9 plasma level at cochlear implantation is a promising prognostic marker for CI outcome.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=159520276&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,159520276,20,12,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wprowadzenie: Wytypowanie biomarkerów neuroplastyczności w leczeniu głuchoty wrodzonej pozwoliłoby na zidentyfikowanie dzieci obarczonych ryzykiem niepowodzenia rehabilitacji słuchu i mowy po wszczepieniu implantu ślimakowego. MMP-9 jest proteinazą o udokumentowanej roli w procesach neuroplastyczności leżących u podłoża wielu stanów patologicznych i fizjologicznych w organizmie człowieka. Materiał i metody: Przeprowadzone zostało podłużne, prospektywne badanie kohortowe 61 dzieci z głuchotą wrodzoną, leczonych za pomocą wszczepienia implantu ślimakowego. Celem badania było zbadanie występowania wariantów genetycznych matrix metaloproteinazy 9 (MMP9) oraz poziomów MMP-9 w osoczu dzieci włączonych do badania oraz ocena rozwoju słuchowego przy użyciu kwestionariusza LittlEARs (LEAQ). Badanie LEAQ wykonano w trzech interwałach czasowych, badanie poziomu MMP-9 w osoczu wykonano podczas wszczepienia implantu ślimakowego. Wyniki: Potwierdzono istnienie statystycznie istotnej ujemnej korelacji pomiędzy poziomem MMP-9 zmierzonym w osoczu podczas wszczepiania implantu ślimakowego a wynikiem LEAQ po 18 miesiącach korzystania z implantu ślimakowego (p < 0.05). Na tej podstawie wyróżniono dwie grupy użytkowników implantu ślimakowego - uzyskujących dobre wyniki i uzyskujących słabe wyniki słuchowe po 18 miesiącach rehabilitacji słuchu i mowy. Występowanie każdego z wariantów genetycznych MMP9: rs3918242, rs20544, rs2234681 z grupie użytkowników z dobrymi wynikami różni się od ich występowania w grupie z słabymi wynikami słuchowymi. Wnioski: W badaniu wykazano, iż u dzieci z głuchotą wrodzoną, u których poziom MMP-9 mierzony w osoczu podczas wszczepienia implantu ślimakowego był niższy niż 150 ng/ml, mogą uzyskać wysoki wynik LEAQ po 18 miesiącach rehabilitacji słuchu i mowy. Wskazuje to, że poziom MMP-9 w osoczu mierzony podczas wszczepienia implantu ślimakowego jest dobrym czynnikiem prognostycznym funkcjonalnych wyników implantacji ślimakowej w głuchocie wrodzonej.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SSQ and SHQ were then presented in a counterbalanced order, in a self-report mode, in a population of 230 HI subjects (mean age = 54 years and pure-tone audiometry [PTA] on the better ear = 28 dB HL) and 100 NH subjects (mean age = 21 years). The SHQ feasibility, readability, and psychometric properties were systematically investigated using reliability indices, cluster, and factor analyses and multiregression analyses. SHQ characteristics were compared both to different literature data obtained with different language versions and to the SSQ scores obtained in the same population.Results: Internal validity was high and very good reproducibility of scores and intersubject variability were obtained across the 24 items between the English and French SHQ for NH subjects. Factor and cluster analyses concurred in identifying five correlated factors, corresponding to several SHQ subscales: (1) speech in noise (corresponding to SHQ subscales 7 and 8), (2) localization of voice sounds from behind, (3) speech in quiet (corresponding to SHQ subscale 1), (4) localization of everyday sounds, and (5) localization of voices and music (corresponding to parts of the SHQ localization subscale). Correlations between SSQ subscales and SHQ factors identified the greatest correlations between SHQ factors 2, 4, and 5 and SSQ spatial subscales, whereas SHQ factor 1 had the greatest correlation with SSQ_speech. SHQ and SSQ scores were similar, whether in NH subjects (8.5 versus 8.4) or in HI subjects (6.6 for both), sharing more than 80% of variance. The SHQ localization subscale gave similar scores as the SSQ spatial subscale, sharing more than 75% of variance. Construct validity identified better ear PTA and PTA asymmetry as the two main predictors of SHQ scores, to a degree similar to that seen for the SSQ. The SHQ was shorter, easier to read and less sensitive to the number of years of formal education than the SSQ, but this came at a cost of ecological validity, which was rated higher for the SSQ than for the SHQ.Conclusions: A comparison of factor analysis outcomes among the English, Dutch, and French versions of the SHQ confirmed good conceptual equivalence across languages and robustness of the SHQ for use in international settings. In addition, SHQ and SSQ scores showed remarkable similarities, suggesting the possibility of extrapolating the results from one questionnaire to the other.

Results from animal models detailing the effects of specific cochlear injuries on audiometric profiles may be used to understand the mechanisms underlying hearing loss in older humans and predict cochlear pathologies associated with certain audiometric configurations (""audiometric phenotypes""). Patterns of hearing loss associated with cochlear pathology in animal models were used to define schematic boundaries of human audiograms. Pathologies included evidence for metabolic, sensory, and a mixed metabolic + sensory phenotype; an older normal phenotype without threshold elevation was also defined. Audiograms from a large sample of older adults were then searched by a human expert for ""exemplars"" (best examples) of these phenotypes, without knowledge of the human subject demographic information. Mean thresholds and slopes of higher frequency thresholds of the audiograms assigned to the four phenotypes were consistent with the predefined schematic boundaries and differed significantly from each other. Significant differences in age, gender, and noise exposure history provided external validity for the four phenotypes. Three supervised machine learning classifiers were then used to assess reliability of the exemplar training set to estimate the probability that newly obtained audiograms exhibited one of the four phenotypes. These procedures classified the exemplars with a high degree of accuracy; classifications of the remaining cases were consistent with the exemplars with respect to average thresholds and demographic information.

This study aimed to investigate the topological features of the brain functional network and structural dysfunction of the central nervous system in ARHL using graph theory. Methods: Forty-six patients with ARHL and forty-five age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls were recruited to undergo a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan in this study. Graph theory was applied to analyze the topological properties of the functional connectomes by studying the local and global organization of neural networks. Results: Compared with healthy controls, the patient group showed increased local efficiency (Eloc) and clustering coefficient (Cp) of the small-world network. Besides, the degree centrality (Dc) and nodal efficiency (Ne) values of the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) in the patient group showed a decrease in contrast with the healthy control group. In addition, the intra-modular interaction of the occipital lobe module and the inter-modular interaction of the parietal occipital module decreased in the patient group, which was positively correlated with Dc and Ne. The intra-modular interaction of the occipital lobe module decreased in the patient group, which was negatively correlated with the Eloc. Conclusion: Based on fMRI and graph theory, we indicate the aberrant small-world network topology in ARHL and dysfunctional interaction of the occipital lobe and parietal lobe, emphasizing the importance of dysfunctional left IOG.

However, data are scarce, especially on adult populations, and a possible involvement of the central auditory areas has not been investigated yet. We performed a multicenter cross-sectional audiological and single-center 3Tesla brain perfusion MRI study enrolling 77 transfusion-dependent/non transfusion-dependent adult patients and 56 healthy controls. Pure tone audiometry, demographics, clinical/laboratory and cognitive functioning data were recorded.Results: Half of patients (52%) presented with high-frequency hearing deficit, with overt hypoacusia (Pure Tone Average (PTA) > 25 dB) in 35%, irrespective of iron chelation or clinical phenotype. Bilateral voxel clusters of significant relative hypoperfusion were found in the auditory cortex of beta-thalassemia patients, regardless of clinical phenotype. In controls and transfusion-dependent (but not in non-transfusion-dependent) patients, the relative auditory cortex perfusion values increased linearly with age (p < 0.04). Relative auditory cortex perfusion values showed a significant U-shaped correlation with PTA values among hearing loss patients, and a linear correlation with the full scale intelligence quotient (right side p = 0.01, left side p = 0.02) with its domain related to communication skills (right side p = 0.04, left side p = 0.07) in controls but not in beta-thalassemia patients. Audiometric test results did not correlate to cognitive test scores in any subgroup.Conclusions: In conclusion, primary auditory cortex perfusion changes are a metabolic hallmark of adult beta-thalassemia, thus suggesting complex remodeling of the hearing function, that occurs regardless of chelation therapy and before clinically manifest hearing loss.

The aim of this study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of postimplant speech perception and oral language performance in children with hearing loss who receive a cochlear implant. The authors hypothesized positive correlations between blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation in brain regions related to auditory language processing and attention and scores on the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool, Second Edition (CELF-P2) and the Early Speech Perception Test for Profoundly Hearing-Impaired Children (ESP), in children with congenital hearing loss.Design: Eleven children with congenital hearing loss were recruited for the present study based on referral for clinical MRI and other inclusion criteria. All participants were <24 months at fMRI scanning and <36 months at first implantation. A silent background fMRI acquisition method was performed to acquire fMRI during auditory stimulation. A voxel-based analysis technique was utilized to generate z maps showing significant contrast in brain activation between auditory stimulation conditions (spoken narratives and narrow band noise). CELF-P2 and ESP were administered 2 years after implantation. Because most participants reached a ceiling on ESP, a voxel-wise regression analysis was performed between preimplant fMRI activation and postimplant CELF-P2 scores alone. Age at implantation and preimplant hearing thresholds were controlled in this regression analysis.Results: Four brain regions were found to be significantly correlated with CELF-P2 scores. These clusters of positive correlation encompassed the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, areas in the prefrontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus. For the story versus silence contrast, CELF-P2 core language score demonstrated significant positive correlation with activation in the right angular gyrus (r = 0.95), left medial frontal gyrus (r = 0.94), and left cingulate gyrus (r = 0.96). For the narrow band noise versus silence contrast, the CELF-P2 core language score exhibited significant positive correlation with activation in the left angular gyrus (r = 0.89; for all clusters, corrected p < 0.05).Conclusions: Four brain regions related to language function and attention were identified that correlated with CELF-P2. Children with better oral language performance postimplant displayed greater activation in these regions preimplant. The results suggest that despite auditory deprivation, these regions are more receptive to gains in oral language development performance of children with hearing loss who receive early intervention via cochlear implantation. The present study suggests that oral language outcome following cochlear implant may be predicted by preimplant fMRI with auditory stimulation using natural speech.",Academic Journal,diagnostic images,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=116787223&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,116787223,30,37,4,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM26689275,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We utilized a vowel contrast, /a‐i/, and a consonant‐vowel contrast, /ba‐da/, to examine speech discrimination in 47 NH infants and 40 infants with HL. At Mean age =3 months, EEG recorded from 11 scalp electrodes was used to compute the time‐frequency mismatched response (TF‐MMRSE) to the contrasts; at Mean age =9 months, behavioral discrimination was assessed using a head turn task. A machine learning (ML) classifier was used to predict behavioral discrimination when given an arbitrary TF‐MMRSE as input, achieving accuracies of 73% for exact classification and 92% for classification within a distance of one class. Linear fits revealed a robust relationship regardless of hearing status or speech contrast. TF‐MMRSE responses in the delta (1–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–8 Hz), and alpha (8–12 Hz) bands explained the most variance in behavioral task performance.

Method: A data set that is representative of the older adult U.S. population with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss was constructed from the audiometric data of 934 adults (aged 55-85 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 1999-2012. Two clustering approaches were implemented to generate common REAR configurations for eight frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) at three input levels (55, 65, and 75 dB SPL). (a) In the REAR-based clustering approach, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey audiograms were first converted to REAR targets and then clustered to generate common REAR configurations. (b) In the audiogram-based clustering approach, the audiograms were first clustered into common hearing loss profiles and then converted to REAR configurations. The trade-off between the number of available REAR configurations and the percentage of the U.S. population whose hearing loss could be fit by at least one of them (i.e., percent coverage) was evaluated. Hearing loss fit was defined as less than ± 5-dB difference between an individual's REAR targets and those of the clustered REAR configuration. Results: Percent coverage increases with the number of available REAR configurations, with four configurations resulting in 75% population coverage. Overall, REAR-based clustering yielded 5 percentage points better coverage on average compared to audiogram-based clustering. Conclusions: The common REAR configurations can be used for programming the gain frequency responses in preconfigured over-the-counter hearing aids and provide clinically appropriate amplification settings for older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=145494269&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,145494269,34,29,3,"Rockville, Maryland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The associated conductive hearing loss is a major concern for hearing health professionals. The aim of the present study was to describe the configuration of pure tone audiograms of children with OME and to design a statistical stratification algorithm to facilitate hearing loss profiling in children with OME. Methods: School age children with OME were recruited. Bone and air conduction thresholds were obtained using standard procedures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to determine audiometric profile groups. The Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test was used to measure sentence perception in children for cluster analysis validity assessment. Results: Ninety-seven children (164 ears) aged between 72 months and 153 months were examined. Air conduction thresholds averaged for 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz were in the range of 8.3-53.3 dB HL with a mean of 26.8 dB HL. Bone conduction thresholds were found to be influenced by middle ear pathology with a maximal elevation at 2000 Hz of 25 dB HL. Four audiometric profiles were identified. Cluster 1 contained 54 ears (32.9%) with normal or near normal hearing, Clusters 2 contained 37 ears (22.6%) with mild hearing loss, Cluster 3 included 48 ears (29.3%) and Cluster 4 included 25 ears (15.2%) with moderate hearing loss. Stability and validity of the four-cluster profiling procedure was examined and established with satisfactory results. Conclusions: OME in children is associated with pure tone hearing thresholds ranging from normal to moderate hearing loss. The hierarchical clustering algorithm proved useful as a novel means of profiling hearing loss in children with OME and may assist in identifying affected children at greater risk of auditory disadvantage.",Academic Journal,equations & formulas,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=128153455&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,128153455,35,40,10,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",gender,Male,gender,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings: In this cohort study, sound environments cataloged using machine learning for cochlear implants were measured by 2746 datalogs for 262 children using cochlear implants before and during 2 years of COVID-19 lockdowns in Ontario, Canada. Due to school closures during lockdowns, school-aged children experienced significantly decreased exposure to spoken language, which has not recovered to the prepandemic baseline. Meaning: This study suggests that school closures due to COVID-19 lockdowns are associated with reduced exposure to spoken communications among children using cochlear implants during sensitive periods of development. Importance: School closures and other COVID-19–related restrictions could decrease children's exposure to speech during important stages of development. Objective: To assess whether significant decreases in exposure to spoken communication found during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic among children using cochlear implants are confirmed for a larger cohort of children and were sustained over the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used datalogs collected from children with cochlear implants during clinical visits to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2018, to November 11, 2021. Children with severe to profound hearing loss using cochlear implants were studied because their devices monitored and cataloged levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs) and because their hearing and spoken language development was particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Statistical analyses were conducted between January 2022 and August 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Daily hours of sound were captured by the cochlear implant datalogging system and categorized into 6 auditory scene categories, including speech and speech-in-noise. Time exposed to speech was calculated as the sum of daily hours in speech and daily hours in speech-in-noise. Residual hearing in the ear without an implant of children with unilateral cochlear implants was measured by pure tone audiometry. Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of 95% CIs using the Satterthwaite method. Results: Datalogs (n = 2746) from 262 children (137 with simultaneous bilateral cochlear implants [74 boys (54.0%); mean (SD) age, 5.8 (3.5 years)], 38 with sequential bilateral cochlear implants [24 boys (63.2%); mean (SD) age, 9.1 (4.2) years], and 87 with unilateral cochlear implants [40 boys (46.0%); mean (SD) age, 7.9 (4.6) years]) who were preschool aged (n = 103) and school aged (n = 159) before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in analyses. There was a slight increase in use among preschool-aged bilateral cochlear implant users through the pandemic (early pandemic, 1.4 h/d [95% CI, 0.3-2.5 h/d]; late pandemic, 2.3 h/d [95% CI, 0.6-4.0 h/d]) and little change in use among school-aged bilateral cochlear implant users (early pandemic, −0.6 h/d [95% CI, −1.1 to −0.05 h/d]; late pandemic, −0.3 h/d [95% CI, −0.9 to 0.4 h/d]). However, use decreased during the late pandemic period among school-aged children with unilateral cochlear implants (−1.8 h/d [95% CI,−3.0 to −0.6 h/d]), particularly among children with good residual hearing in the ear without an implant. Prior to the pandemic, children were exposed to speech for approximately 50% of the time they used their cochlear implants (preschool-aged children: bilateral cochlear implants, 46.6% [95% CI, 46.5%-47.2%] and unilateral cochlear implants, 52.1% [95% CI, 50.7%-53.5%]; school-aged children: bilateral cochlear implants, 47.6% [95% CI, 46.8%-48.4%] and unilateral cochlear implants, 51.0% [95% CI, 49.4%-52.6%]). School-aged children in both groups experienced significantly decreased speech exposure in the early pandemic period (bilateral cochlear implants, −12.1% [−14.6% to −9.4%]; unilateral cochlear implants, −15.5% [−20.4% to −10.7%]) and late pandemic periods (bilateral cochlear implants, −5.3% [−8.0% to −2.6%]; unilateral cochlear implants, −11.2% [−15.3% to −7.1%]) compared with the prepandemic baseline. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study using datalogs from children using cochlear implants suggests that a sustained reduction in children's access to spoken communication was found during more than 2 years of COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and school closures.

Initial hearing screening was undertaken through an otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. Participants aged 4+ years who failed this test in both ears or for whom an OAE reading could not be taken underwent a manual pure-tone audiometry (PTA) screening. Cases of hearing impairment were defined as those with pure-tone average ≥41 dBHL in adults and ≥35 dBHL in children in the better ear, or children under age 4 who failed the OAE test in both ears.

Method: Audiometric testing data collected in the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study from participants (n = 1,369) with four visits (1993--1995, 1998--2000, 2003-- 2005, and 2009--2010) were included (10,952 audiograms). Cluster analyses (Wald's method) were used to identify audiometric patterns. Maximum allowable threshold values were defined for each cluster to create an ordered scale. Progression was defined as a two-step change. Results: An eight-step scale was developed to capture audiogram shape and severity of hearing impairment. Of the 1,094 participants classified as having normal hearing based on a pure-tone average, only 25% (n = 277) were classified as Level 1 (all thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL) on the new scale, whereas 17% (n = 182) were Levels 4--6. During the 16-year follow-up, 64.9% of those at Level 1 progressed. There was little regression using this scale. Conclusions: This is the first scale developed from population-based longitudinal cohort data to capture audiogram shape across time. This simple, standardized scale is easy to apply, reduces misclassification of normal hearing, and may be a useful method for identifying risk factors for early, preclinical, age-related changes in hearing.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=142221613&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,142221613,40,29,1,"Rockville, Maryland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism behind HL in AD remains elusive. A possible mechanism is cognitive load hypothesis, which postulates that over-processing of degraded auditory signals in the auditory cortex leads to deficits in other cognitive functions. Given mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD, untangling the association between HL and MCI might provide insights for potential mechanism behind HL. Methods: We included 85 cognitively normal (CN) subjects with no hearing loss (NHL), 24 CN with HL, 103 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with NHL, and 23 MCI with HL from the ADNI database. All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological scale assessments. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was used to reflect spontaneous brain activity. The mixed-effects analysis was applied to explore the interactive effects between HL and cognitive status (GRF corrected, voxel p -value <0.005, cluster p -value < 0.05, two-tailed). Then, the FDG data was included to further reflect the regional neuronal abnormalities. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis was performed between imaging metrics and cognitive scores to explore the clinical significance (Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.05). Results: The interactive effects primarily located in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and bilateral inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Post-hoc analysis showed that NC with HL had lower fALFF in bilateral ITG compared to NC with NHL. NC with HL had higher fALFF in the left STG and decreased fALFF in bilateral ITG compared to MCI with HL. In addition, NC with HL had lower fALFF in the right ITG compared to MCI with NHL. Correlation analysis revealed that fALFF was associated with MMSE and ADNI-VS, while SUVR was associated with MMSE, MoCA, ADNI-EF and ADNI-Lan. Conclusion: HL showed different effects on NC and MCI stages. NC had increased spontaneous brain activity in auditory cortex while decreased activity in the ITG. Such pattern altered with disease stage changing and manifested as decreased activity in auditory cortex along with increased activity in ITG in MCI. This suggested that the cognitive load hypothesis may be the underlying mechanism behind HL.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=154972056&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,154972056,42,14,,,minor,Human,minor,Geriatric Depression Scale,age,Aged: 65+ years,,,age,"Aged, 80 & over",gender,Male,gender,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, Yanbo","Zhang, Tianyi","Chen, Yanxing","Liu, Zhirong","Huang, Peiyu","Zhang, Minming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A subset of 17 subjects with repeated audiograms were used for longitudinal analysis.Interventions: All audiological thresholds were run through the web-based AudioGene v4.0 software.Main Outcome Measures: Sensitivity for accurate prediction of DFNA9 for cross-sectional data and concordance of correct prediction for longitudinal auditory data.Results: DFNA9 was predicted with a sensitivity of 93.7% in a series of 222 cross-sectionally collected audiological thresholds (76.1% as first gene locus). When using the hearing thresholds of the best ear, the sensitivity was 94.6%. The sensitivity was significantly higher in DFNA9 patients aged younger than 40 and aged 60 years or older, compared to the age group of 40 to 59 years, with resp. 97.6% (p < 0.0001) and 98.8% (p < 0.0001) accurate predictions. An average concordance of 91.6% was found to show the same response in all successive longitudinal audiometric data per patient.Conclusions: Audioprofiling software can accurately predict DFNA9 in an area with a high prevalence of confirmed carriers of the p.(Pro51Ser) variant in the COCH-gene.

This included the validation of the new short-form on an independent sample and an in-depth, comparative analysis of all existing, full and short SSQ forms.Design: Data from a previous study involving 98 normal-hearing (NH) individuals and 196 people with hearing impairments (HI), non hearing aid wearers, along with results from several other published SSQ studies, were used for developing the short-form. Data from a new and independent sample of 35 NH and 88 HI hearing aid wearers were used to validate the new short-form. Factor and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to check the factor structure and internal consistency of the new short-form. In addition, the new short-form was compared with all other SSQ forms, including the full SSQ, the German SSQ15, the SSQ12, and the SSQ5. Construct validity was further assessed by testing statistical relationships between scores and audiometric factors, including pure-tone threshold averages (PTAs) and left/right PTA asymmetry. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to compare the ability of different SSQ forms to discriminate between NH and HI (HI non hearing aid wearers and HI hearing aid wearers) individuals.Results: Compared all other SSQ forms, including the full SSQ, the new short-form showed negligible cross-loading across the three main subscales and greater discriminatory power between NH and HI subjects (as indicated by a larger area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve), as well as between the main subscales (especially Speech and Qualities). Moreover, the new, 5-item Spatial subscale showed increased sensitivity to left/right PTA asymmetry. Very good internal consistency and homogeneity and high correlations with the SSQ were obtained for all short-forms.Conclusions: While maintaining the three-factor structure of the full SSQ, and exceeding the latter in terms of construct validity and sensitivity to audiometric variables, the new 15-item SSQ affords a substantial reduction in the number of items and, thus, in test time. Based on overall scores, Speech subscores, or Spatial subscores, but not Qualities subscores, the 15-item SSQ appears to be more sensitive to differences in self-evaluated hearing abilities between NH and HI subjects than the full SSQ.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=137129492&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,137129492,45,40,4,"Baltimore, Maryland",age,Adult: 19-44 years,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,age,Aged: 65+ years,pmid,NLM30461444,age,Adolescent: 13-18 years,gender,Female,gender,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No prior studies have attempted a contemporary machine learning approach to predict depression using subjective and objective hearing loss predictors. The objective was to deploy supervised machine learning to predict scores on a validated depression scale using subjective and objective audiometric variables and other health determinant predictors.Design: A large predictor set of health determinants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015-2016 database was used to predict adults' scores on a validated instrument to screen for the presence and severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). After model training, the relative influence of individual predictors on depression scores was stratified and analyzed. Model prediction performance was determined by prediction error metrics.Results: The test set mean absolute error was 3.03 (95% confidence interval: 2.91 to 3.14) and 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 2.48 to 2.62) on datasets with audiology-only predictors and all predictors, respectively, on the PHQ-9's 27-point scale. Participants' self-reported frustration when talking to members of family or friends due to hearing loss was the fifth-most influential of all predictors. Of the top 10 most influential audiometric predictors, five were related to social contexts, two for significant noise exposure, two objective audiometric parameters, and one presence of bothersome tinnitus.Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict PHQ-9 depression scale scores from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. The most influential audiometric predictors of higher scores on a validated depression scale were social dynamics of hearing loss and not objective audiometric testing. Such models could be useful in predicting depression scale scores at the point-of-care in conjunction with a standard audiologic assessment.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=152611873&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,152611873,46,42,4,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM33577219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Cross-sectional data from 30 individuals with unilateral deafness and 30 individuals with normal hearing (age, 14 to 75 years) were obtained through structured interviews and tests of audiovisual, auditory-only, and visual-only speech perception. Results: In individuals with permanent unilateral deafness, 93% reported that hearing loss affected communication. Eighty-seven percent reported problems with speech perception in noisy settings. Other consequences were feelings of exclusion, reduced well-being, and extensive use of speech perception strategies. Inducing temporary unilateral deafness (through short-term blocking of one ear) in normal-hearing subjects produced similar effects on speech perception (27% score) as those experienced by unilaterally deaf subjects (25% score). Conclusions: Individuals with unilateral deafness experienced a significant disability in auditory function that affected their communication and social interaction. The major challenges were communicating in situations with background noise, in poor acoustic surroundings, and with limited access to speech-reading or direct listening.

It was found that for different audiological diagnostic questions a combination of measures using different weights of the parameters is useful. A set of four to six measures was already sufficient to achieve maximum classification performance which indicates that the measures contain redundant information.

However, individual response to tDCS has proven to be variable. We investigated the feasibility of using random forest classification to predict the response to high-definition (HD) tDCS for tinnitus relief.Design: A retrospective analysis was performed on a dataset consisting of 99 patients with subjective tinnitus receiving six consecutive sessions of HD-tDCS at the Antwerp University Hospital. A baseline assessment consisted of pure-tone audiometry and a set of questionnaires including the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Random forest classification was applied to predict, based on baseline questionnaire scores and hearing levels, whether each individual responded positively to the treatment (defined as a decrease of at least 13 points on the TFI). Further testing of the model was performed on an independent cohort of 32 patients obtained from the tinnitus center at the University of Regensburg.Results: Twenty-four participants responded positively to the HD-tDCS treatment. The random forest classifier predicted treatment response with an accuracy of 85.71% (100% sensitivity, 81.48% specificity), significantly outperforming a more traditional logistic regression approach. Performance of the classifier on an independent cohort was slightly but not significantly above chance level (71.88% accuracy, 66.67% sensitivity, 73.08% specificity). Feature importance analyses revealed that baseline tinnitus severity, co-occurrence of depressive symptoms and handedness were the most important predictors of treatment response. Baseline TFI scores were significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders.Conclusions: The proposed random forest classifier predicted treatment response with a high accuracy, significantly outperforming a more traditional statistical approach. Machine learning methods to predict treatment response might ultimately be used in a clinical setting to guide targeted treatment recommendations for individual tinnitus patients.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=159790753&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,159790753,51,43,6,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM35666538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Van Rompaey, Vincent","Gilles, Annick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors have combined these capabilities into an online (i.e., web-based) pure-tone audiogram estimator intended to empower researchers and clinicians with advanced hearing tests without the need for custom programming or special hardware. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of this new online machine learning audiogram method relative to a commonly used hearing threshold estimation technique also implemented online for the first time in the same platform.Design: The authors performed air conduction pure-tone audiometry on 21 participants between the ages of 19 and 79 years (mean 41, SD 21) exhibiting a wide range of hearing abilities. For each ear, two repetitions of online machine learning audiogram estimation and two repetitions of online modified Hughson-Westlake ascending-descending audiogram estimation were acquired by an audiologist using the online software tools. The estimated hearing thresholds of these two techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz).Results: The two threshold estimation methods delivered very similar threshold estimates at standard audiogram frequencies. Specifically, the mean absolute difference between threshold estimates was 3.24 ± 5.15 dB. The mean absolute differences between repeated measurements of the online machine learning procedure and between repeated measurements of the Hughson-Westlake procedure were 2.85 ± 6.57 dB and 1.88 ± 3.56 dB, respectively. The machine learning method generated estimates of both threshold and spread (i.e., the inverse of psychometric slope) continuously across the entire frequency range tested from fewer samples on average than the modified Hughson-Westlake procedure required to estimate six discrete thresholds.Conclusions: Online machine learning audiogram estimation in its current form provides all the information of conventional threshold audiometry with similar accuracy and reliability in less time. More importantly, however, this method provides additional audiogram details not provided by other methods. This standardized platform can be readily extended to bone conduction, masking, spectrotemporal modulation, speech perception, etc., unifying audiometric testing into a single comprehensive procedure efficient enough to become part of the standard audiologic workup.",Academic Journal,algorithm,pictorial,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=137129490&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,137129490,52,40,4,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM30358656,,,,,,,,,,,,,tables/charts,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,"Degen, Eleanor A.","Buchbinder, Jenna M.","Heisey, Katherine L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: Cross-sectional analysis nested within a clusterrandomized trial data across 10 South African TB hospitals. Patients ≥ 13 years old received clinical and audiological evaluations before DR-TB treatment initiation. Results: Of 936 patients, average age was 35 years. One hundred forty-two (15%) reported pre-existing auditory symptoms. Of 482 patients tested by audiometry, 290 (60%) had pre-existing hearing loss.

Fifty-one clusters of 80 people aged 6 months and older were selected using probability-proportionate-to-size sampling. A two-stage hearing screening was conducted using otoacoustic emissions on all participants followed by pure-tone audiometry on those aged 4 years and older who failed otoacoustic emissions. Cases of hearing impairment were defined using the World Health Organization definition of disabling hearing impairment: a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of ≥41 dB HL for adults and ≥31 dB HL for children based on the better ear. Possible causes of hearing impairment were ascertained by a certified audiologist. Reported hearing difficulties were also measured in this survey and compared with audiometry results.Results: Three thousand five hundred seventy-three people were examined (response rate 87%), of whom 52% were female. The prevalence of disabling hearing impairment was 4.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8 to 5.3). Disabling hearing impairment prevalence increased with age from 0.4% in those aged 4 to 17 years (95% CI = 0.2 to 1.1) to 34.7% (95% CI = 28.7 to 41.1) in those aged older than 65 years. No difference in prevalence was seen by sex. Ear examination suggested that the possible cause of disabling hearing impairment was chronic suppurative otitis media for 6.9% of cases and dry perforation for 5.6% cases. For the vast majority of people with disabling hearing impairment, a possible cause could not be established. The overall prevalence of reported or proxy reported hearing impairment was 2.6% (95% CI = 2.0 to 3.4), and this ranged from 0.6% (95% CI = 0.08 to 4.4) in those aged 0 to 3 years to 14.4% (95% CI = 9.8 to 20.7) in those aged older than 65 years.Conclusions: Disabling hearing impairment in Telangana State is common, affecting approximately 1 in 23 people overall and a third of people aged older than 65 years.

However, degraded or filtered auditory input as evidenced in children with cochlear implants (CIs) may result in less efficient or slower language processing as well. To provide insight into the underlying nature of the spoken language difficulties in children with CIs, linguistic profiles of children with CIs are compared with those of hard-of-hearing (HoH) children with conventional hearing aids and children with specific language impairment (SLI). Aims To examine differences in linguistic abilities and profiles of children with CIs as compared with HoH children and children with SLI, and whether the spoken language difficulties of children with CIs mainly lie in limited auditory perception or in language processing problems. Methods & Procedure Differences in linguistic abilities and differential linguistic profiles of 47 children with CI, 66 HoH children with moderate to severe hearing loss, and 127 children with SLI are compared, divided into two age cohorts. Standardized Dutch tests were administered. Factor analyses and cluster analyses were conducted to find homogeneous linguistic profiles of the children. Outcomes & Results The children with CIs were outperformed by their HoH peers and peers with SLI on most linguistic abilities. Concerning the linguistic profiles, the largest group of children with CIs and HoH children shared similar profiles. The profiles observed for most of the children with SLI were different from those of their peers with hearing loss in both age cohorts. Conclusions & Implications Results suggest that the underlying nature of spoken language problems in most children with CIs manifests in limited auditory perception instead of language processing difficulties. However, there appears to be a subgroup of children with CIs whose linguistic profiles resemble those of children with SLI.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=117760351&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,117760351,59,51,5,"Malden, Massachusetts",gender,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second objective was to develop a set of prototype listening situations (PLSs) that describe the speech level, noise level, SNR, availability of visual cues, and locations of speech and noise sources of typical speech listening situations experienced by these individuals.Design: Twenty older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss carried digital recorders for 5 to 6 weeks to record sounds for 10 hours per day. They also repeatedly completed in situ surveys on smartphones several times per day to report the characteristics of their current environments, including the locations of the primary talker (if they were listening to speech) and noise source (if it was noisy) and the availability of visual cues. For surveys where speech listening was indicated, the corresponding audio recording was examined. Speech-plus-noise and noise-only segments were extracted, and the SNR was estimated using a power subtraction technique. SNRs and the associated survey data were subjected to cluster analysis to develop PLSs.Results: The speech level, noise level, and SNR of 894 listening situations were analyzed to address the first objective. Results suggested that as noise levels increased from 40 to 74 dBA, speech levels systematically increased from 60 to 74 dBA, and SNR decreased from 20 to 0 dB. Most SNRs (62.9%) of the collected recordings were between 2 and 14 dB. Very noisy situations that had SNRs below 0 dB comprised 7.5% of the listening situations. To address the second objective, recordings and survey data from 718 observations were analyzed. Cluster analysis suggested that the participants' daily listening situations could be grouped into 12 clusters (i.e., 12 PLSs). The most frequently occurring PLSs were characterized as having the talker in front of the listener with visual cues available, either in quiet or in diffuse noise. The mean speech level of the PLSs that described quiet situations was 62.8 dBA, and the mean SNR of the PLSs that represented noisy environments was 7.4 dB (speech = 67.9 dBA). A subset of observations (n = 280), which was obtained by excluding the data collected from quiet environments, was further used to develop PLSs that represent noisier situations. From this subset, two PLSs were identified. These two PLSs had lower SNRs (mean = 4.2 dB), but the most frequent situations still involved speech from in front of the listener in diffuse noise with visual cues available.Conclusions: The present study indicated that visual cues and diffuse noise were exceedingly common in real-world speech listening situations, while environments with negative SNRs were relatively rare. The characteristics of speech level, noise level, and SNR, together with the PLS information reported by the present study, can be useful for researchers aiming to design ecologically valid assessment procedures to estimate real-world speech communicative functions for older adults with hearing loss.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=128543237&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,128543237,60,39,2,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM29466265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study intends to identify hearing changes in preschoolers who attend the cluster of schools in the Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, CHEDV's region and to emphasize the value of preschool hearing evaluation in order to prevent long-term effects on the child's overall development. Currently, this type of screening is not carried out in our country. Material and methods: 46 children (92 ears), aged between 4 and 6 years old, were evaluated by Santa Maria da Feira school educators using anamnesis, otoscopy, tympanogram, pure-tone air-condution at 0.5-4 kHz and vocal audiometry. Children who displayed changes in these assessments were alerted to the assistant doctor and directed to an ENT consultation. Results: We found that 28% of the ears tested had mild hearing loss and 3% had moderated hearing loss, according to BIAP 02/1. In 57% of the instances (40% type C and 17% type B), the tympanogram appeared altered, meaning that the middle ear was altered in more than half of the examined ears. Additionally, 20 of 46 children (43.47% of the cases) were found to have hearing disorders. Conclusions: The high prevalence of children with hearing disorders found emphasizes the significance of the Pre-School Hearing Screening in the hearing assessment of pre-school aged children to minimize the detrimental effects of hearing on their development, cognition, communication, and interpersonal relationships. It is important to note that such initiatives highlight the necessity to design hearing health education programs in addition to the diagnosis and treatment of middle ear disorders.",Academic Journal,abstract,proceedings,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=161088010&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,161088010,61,12,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Difficulty understanding speech in noise is one of the primary reasons people seek hearing assistance. Despite amplification, many hearing aid users still struggle to understand speech in noise. In response to this persistent problem, hearing aid manufacturers have invested significantly in developing new solutions. Any solution is not without its tradeoffs, and decisions must be made when optimizing and implementing them. Much of this happens behind the scenes, and casual observers fail to appreciate the nuances of developing new hearing aid technologies. The difficulty of communicating this information to clinicians may hinder the use or the fine-tuning of the various technologies available today. The purpose of this issue of Seminars in Hearing is to educate professionals and students in audiology, hearing science, and engineering about different approaches to combat problems related to environmental and wind noise using technologies that include classification, directional microphones, binaural signal processing, beamformers, motion sensors, and machine learning.

The current version utilizes a mixture of deterministic and probabilistic logic which is able to improve over time through a learning effect. This study aimed at assessing whether this learning capacity yields measurable improvements in speech understanding.Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 25 consecutive CI recipients with a median CI use experience of 10 years who came for their annual CI follow-up fitting session. All subjects were assessed by means of speech audiometry with open set monosyllables at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL in quiet with their home MAP. Other psychoacoustic tests were executed depending on the audiologist's clinical judgment. The home MAP and the corresponding test results were entered into FOX. If FOX suggested to make MAP changes, they were implemented and another speech audiometry was performed with the new MAP.Results: FOX suggested MAP changes in 21 subjects (84%). The within-subject comparison showed a significant median improvement of 10, 3, 1, and 7% at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL, respectively. All but two subjects showed an instantaneous improvement in their mean speech audiometric score.Discussion: Persons with long-term CI use, who received a FOX-assisted CI fitting at least 6 months ago, display improved speech understanding after MAP modifications, as recommended by the current version of FOX. This can be explained only by intrinsic improvements in FOX's algorithms, as they have resulted from learning. This learning is an inherent feature of artificial intelligence and it may yield measurable benefit in speech understanding even in long-term CI recipients.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=123415152&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,123415152,65,18,4,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",age,Adolescent: 13-18 years,age,Child: 6-12 years,age,"Aged, 80 & over",pmid,NLM28498083,age,Adult: 19-44 years,age,Aged: 65+ years,gender,Female,gender,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the subjects were exposed to complex noise. Each subject was given an otologic examination to determine their pure-tone hearing threshold levels and had their personal full-shift noise recorded. For each subject, the hearing loss was evaluated according to the hearing impairment definition of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Age, exposure duration, equivalent A-weighted SPL (LAeq), and median kurtosis were used as the input for four machine learning algorithms, that is, support vector machine, neural network multilayer perceptron, random forest, and adaptive boosting. Both classification and regression models were developed to predict noise-induced hearing loss applying these four machine learning algorithms. Two indexes, area under the curve and prediction accuracy, were used to assess the performances of the classification models for predicting hearing impairment of workers. Root mean square error was used to quantify the prediction performance of the regression models.Results: A prediction accuracy between 78.6 and 80.1% indicated that the four classification models could be useful tools to assess noise-induced hearing impairment of workers exposed to various complex occupational noises. A comprehensive evaluation using both the area under the curve and prediction accuracy showed that the support vector machine model achieved the best score and thus should be selected as the tool with the highest potential for predicting hearing impairment from the occupational noise exposures in this study. The root mean square error performance indicated that the four regression models could be used to predict noise-induced hearing loss quantitatively and the multilayer perceptron regression model had the best performance.Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms are potential tools for the evaluation and prediction of noise-induced hearing impairment in workers exposed to diverse complex industrial noises.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=136019495&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,136019495,66,40,3,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM30142102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to 1) To report on the feasibility of RAHL; 2) report on the estimated prevalence and causes of hearing loss in Gao'an.Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted in September-October 2018. Forty-seven clusters in Gao'an County were selected using probability-proportionate-to-size sampling. Within clusters, compact segment sampling was conducted to select 30 people aged 50+. A questionnaire was completed covering sociodemographics, hearing health, and risk factors. Automated pure-tone audiometry was completed for all participants, using smartphone-based audiometry (hearTest), at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz (kHz). All participants had their ears examined by an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor, using otoscopy, and probable causes of hearing loss assigned. Prevalence estimates were age and sex standardised to the Jiangxi population. Feasibility of a cluster size of 30 was examined by assessing the response rate, and the proportion of clusters completed in 1 day.Results: 1344 of 1421 eligible participants completed the survey (94.6%). 100% of clusters were completed in 1 day. The survey was completed in 4.5 weeks. The prevalence of moderate or greater hearing loss (pure-tone average of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz of > = 41dBHL in the better ear) was 16.3% (95% CI = 14.3, 18.5) and for any level of hearing loss (pure-tone average of > = 26dBHL in the better ear) the prevalence was 53.2% (95% CI = 49.2, 57.1). The majority of hearing loss was due to acquired sensorineural causes (91.7% left; 92.1% right). Overall 54.0% of the population aged 50+ (108,000 people) are in need of diagnostic audiology services, 3.4% were in need of wax removal (7000 people), and 4.8% were in need of surgical services (9500 people). Hearing aid coverage was 0.4%.Conclusion: The RAHL survey protocol is feasible, demonstrated through the number of people examined per day, and the high response rate. The survey was completed in a much shorter period than previous all-age surveys in China. Some remaining challenges included assignment of causes of probable sensorineural loss.

The functional changes occurring at these synapses during aging are not fully understood. Here, we characterized this aging process in IHCs of C57BL/6J mice, a strain which is known to carry a cadherin-23 mutation and experiences early hearing loss with age. These mice, while displaying a large increase in auditory brainstem thresholds due to 50% loss of IHC synaptic ribbons at middle age (postnatal day 365), paradoxically showed enhanced acoustic startle reflex suggesting a hyperacusis-like response. The auditory defect was associated with a large shrinkage of the IHCs' cell body and a drastic enlargement of their remaining presynaptic ribbons which were facing enlarged postsynaptic AMPAR clusters.

This is only partly true, as recent studies have demonstrated the importance of low-frequency information. This research was taken up to develop, standardize, and validate auditory low-frequency word lists in Hindi, an Indian language. Material and methods: The first phase of the study involved collection of bisyllabic words followed by verification by a native linguist. Words were then short-listed based on familiarity ratings given by 10 adult native speakers; those words were recorded and the best recorded words selected through subjective and objective analysis. Then, using Fast Fourier Transform and k-means clustering, words with more energy below 1.5 kHz were isolated. Finally, equally difficult 10 word lists were generated by obtaining psychometric function curves. Finally, lists were administered on 40 adult normal hearing participants at 0, 10, 20, and 30 dB sensation level (SL). The word list was also standardized on 100 Hindi speakers at 40 dB SL. Results: Results showed a similar trend of increase in speech identification scores with increase in SL across all lists except list 4. During the final phase, developed lists were validated on 10 simulated low-frequency cochlear hearing loss participants. Hearing loss was simulated using Matlab and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) software. Results of validation revealed that auditory low-frequency word lists were sensitive enough to tap the speech understanding difficulty in the simulated condition. Conclusions: The developed word lists can be used clinically to assess communication ability in individuals with rising hearing loss. The word lists also have the potential to assess the performance after amplification provided to individuals with rising hearing loss.",Academic Journal,pictorial,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=124209295&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,124209295,71,6,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,"Introducción: Comúnmente se cree que la información codificada en las altas frecuencias es fundamental en el proceso de la comprensión del habla. Sin embargo, en vista de los presentes estudios, los cuales demuestran una importancia considerable de la información codificada en las bajas frecuencias, este argumento es solo en parte verdad. En el marco de los estudios descritos en la presente publicación, se han elaborado, estandarizado y normalizado listas de palabras de baja frecuencia para el idioma hindi, una de las lenguas indoarias. Materiales y métodos: En la primera fase de los trabajos de investigación, se agruparon palabras bisílabas, verificadas por un lingüista hablante nativo del idioma. A continuación, en base a la valoración del conocimiento de las palabras, realizada por 10 hablantes nativos del idioma, dicha lista se acortó y gravó, y las mejores versiones de la grabación se eligieron según una valoración subjetiva y objetiva. El siguiente paso fue aislar palabras por debajo de 1,5 kHz mediante transformada rápida de Fourier y algoritmo K-means. En la fase final se crearon 10 listas de palabras del mismo grado de dificultad según curvas psicométricas y, por consiguiente, cada una de las listas se usó para examinar a 40 personas con la audición normal, aplicando un nivel percepción de estímulos sonoros de 0, 10, 20 y 30 dB SL. Dichas listas se sometieron a una estandarización que abarcó 100 hablantes del idioma hindi, presentándoles las palabras a un nivel de 40 dB SL. Resultados: En todas las listas, salvo la lista no. 4, se ha observado una mejora similar del grado de identificación del habla, proporcional al aumento de la percepción de estímulos sonoros (SL). En la etapa final, las listas creadas se normalizaron en un grupo de 10 pacientes con pérdida coclear, utilizando el programa Matlab y el software del Instituto Nacional para la Seguridad y Salud Ocupacional (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH). En el proceso de normalización se ha demostrado que en condiciones experimentales las listas de palabras de baja frecuencia son suficientemente sensibles para poder identificar las dificultades en la comprensión del habla. Conclusiones: Las listas elaboradas podrán utilizarse en la evaluación clínica de habilidades comunicativas en pacientes con una pérdida de audición progresiva.

Jednak w świetle obecnych badań, w których wykazano niemałe znaczenie informacji kodowanej w niskich częstotliwościach, twierdzenie to jest tylko po części prawdziwe. W ramachbadań opisywanych w niniejszej publikacji opracowano, wystandaryzowano oraz znormalizowano niskoczęstotliwościowe listy słowne dla języka Hindi, jednego z języków nowoindyjskich. Materiał i metody: Na pierwszym etapie prac badawczych zestawiono słowa dwusylabowe, zweryfikowane przez językoznawcę, będącego rodzimym użytkownikiem języka. Następnie - na podstawie oceny znajomości słów, dokonanej przez 10 rodzimych użytkowników języka - listę tę skrócono i nagrano, przy czym najlepsze wersje nagrania wybrano na podstawie oceny subiektywnej i obiektywnej. Kolejnym krokiem było wydzielenie słów o ładunku energetycznym poniżej 1,5 kHz na podstawie szybkiej transformaty Fouriera i algorytmu k-średnich. W końcowym etapie stworzono 10 list słownych o podobnym poziomie trudności na podstawie krzywych psychometrycznych, a następnie każdą z list wykorzystano do badania 40 osób w normie słuchowej na poziomie odczucia 0, 10, 20 oraz 30 dB SL. Listy te poddano standaryzacji, obejmującej 100 użytkowników języka Hindi, którym słowa podawano na poziomie 40 dB SL. Wyniki: Za wyjątkiem listy 4, w przypadku wszystkich list zaobserwowano podobną poprawę stopnia identyfikacji mowy, proporcjonalną do wzrostu poziomu odczucia (SL). W końcowym etapie, stworzone listy znormalizowano w grupie 10 pacjentów z ubytkiem ślimakowym, z wykorzystaniem programu Matlab i oprogramowania Państwowego Instytutu Bezpieczeństwa i Higieny Pracy (NIOSH).W procesie normalizacji wykazano, iż w warunkach badania niskoczęstotliwościowe listy słowne są wystarczająco czułe, by wykryć trudności z rozumieniem mowy.

The hearing aid manufacturers' challenge is to propose signal processing strategies that allow speech to emerge in complex sound environments. For this, options such as adaptive directionality of microphone systems and noise reduction are used. The most recent hearing aids use the source localization technique or artificial intelligence to detect useful signals (speech) from those caused by nuisance (noise). Once located, noises are reduced to allow the speech to emerge. Class 1 hearing aids -low-end products- regulated in the 100% health system in France have such treatment options that improve intelligibility in noise. Class 2 hearing aids -high-end products- according to the manufacturers, involve more elaborate algorithms and for a greater number of frequency channels. The objective of this study is to evaluate these options effectiveness for the two hearing aids classes. Material: The hearing simulation platform of the hearing aid training center of the Faculty of Pharmacy in the University of Lorraine (France) has been developed to reproduce complex sound environments and to analyze the output signals of hearing aids placed on the artificial head's ears. Methods: This platform allows to evaluate the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) indicator at the hearing aids output, for different sound environments -several incidences of the voice signal and different spatialization configurations of the noise- and for several input SNR (6 to 9 dB) using the method of Hagerman and Olofsson (Acta Acustica, 2004). Results: The estimated output SNR as a function of frequency for different sound environments is compared to input SNR values. This highlights differences between classes of hearing aids for five different manufacturers, in terms of speech emergence. Conclusions: This work allows to discuss the comparative performance of Class 1 and 2 devices and the algorithmic strategies of hearing aids manufacturers. It shows that all the Class 1 hearing aids even improve SNR for noisy environments. The Class 2 performance is not systematically superior to those of Class 1, depending on the manufacturer.",Academic Journal,abstract,proceedings,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=156437797&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,156437797,72,12,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The participant was a boy aged 4:10 years with severe SSD, who previously had received indirect therapy from age 3 with, very limited results. A single subject ABA design was used. At baseline, whole word match was 0%, Word shape CV match was 39% and PCC was 22, 7%. He had no multisyllabic words, no consonant clusters and no established coronals. Intervention was given 4 days weekly for 3 weeks in two periods with a 7-week intervening break and a post therapy assessments. Therapy was focused on establishing multisyllabic words, iambic stress pattern, clusters and coronals with the principle of using already established elements for targeting new elements. At post therapy assessment, whole word match was 39%, word shape CV match was 71% and PCC 69.1%. Multisyllabic words (86%), coronals (82%) and word initial clusters (80%) were established. Without being targeted, back vowels were also present and segment timing improved.

Current masking protocols are confusing, laborious, and time consuming. Adding a standardized masking protocol to an active machine learning audiogram procedure could potentially alleviate all of these drawbacks by dynamically adapting the masking as needed for each individual. The goal of this study is to determine the accuracy and efficiency of automated machine learning masking for obtaining true hearing thresholds.Design: Dynamically masked automated audiograms were collected for 29 participants between the ages of 21 and 83 (mean 43, SD 20) with a wide range of hearing abilities. Normal-hearing listeners were given unmasked and masked machine learning audiogram tests. Listeners with hearing loss were given a standard audiogram test by an audiologist, with masking stimuli added as clinically determined, followed by a masked machine learning audiogram test. The hearing thresholds estimated for each pair of techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz).Results: Masked and unmasked machine learning audiogram threshold estimates matched each other well in normal-hearing listeners, with a mean absolute difference between threshold estimates of 3.4 dB. Masked machine learning audiogram thresholds also matched well the thresholds determined by a conventional masking procedure, with a mean absolute difference between threshold estimates for listeners with low asymmetry and high asymmetry between the ears, respectively, of 4.9 and 2.6 dB. Notably, out of 6200 masked machine learning audiogram tone deliveries for this study, no instances of tones detected by the nontest ear were documented. The machine learning methods were also generally faster than the manual methods, and for some listeners, substantially so.Conclusions: Dynamically masked audiograms achieve accurate true threshold estimates and reduce test time compared with current clinical masking procedures. Dynamic masking is a compelling alternative to the methods currently used to evaluate individuals with highly asymmetric hearing, yet can also be used effectively and efficiently for anyone.",Academic Journal,Journal Article,,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=146627648&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,146627648,74,41,6,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM32520850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some longitudinal studies point to low help-seeking and subsequent rehabilitation after a failed hearing screening (positive screening result). Some barriers to help-seeking and rehabilitation could be intrinsic to the profiles and needs of people who have failed a hearing screening. Theories of health behavior change could help to understand this population. One of these theories is the transtheoretical (stages-of-change) model of health behavior change, which describes profiles and needs of people facing behavior changes such as seeking help and taking up rehabilitation. According to this model, people go through distinct stages toward health behavior change: precontemplation, contemplation, action, and finally, maintenance. The present study describes the psychometric properties (construct validity) of the stages of change in adults who have failed an online hearing screening. Stages of change were measured with the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA). Principal component analysis is presented, along with cluster analysis. Internal consistency was investigated. Finally, relationships between URICA scores and speech-in-noise recognition threshold, self-reported hearing disability, and self-reported duration of hearing disability are presented. DESIGN: In total, 224 adults who had failed a Swedish online hearing screening test (measure of speech-in-noise recognition) completed further questionnaires online, including the URICA. RESULTS: A principal component analysis identified the stages of precontemplation, contemplation, and action, plus an additional stage, termed preparation (between contemplation and action). According to the URICA, half (50%) of the participants were in the preparation stage of change. The contemplation stage was represented by 38% of participants, while 9% were in the precontemplation stage. Finally, the action stage was represented by approximately 3% of the participants. Cluster analysis identified four stages-of-change clusters: they were named decision making (44% of sample), participation (28% of sample), indecision (16% of sample), and reluctance (12% of sample). The construct validity of the model was good. Participants who reported a more advanced stage of change had significantly greater self-reported hearing disability. However, participants who reported a more advanced stage of change did not have a significantly worse speech-in-noise recognition threshold or reported a significantly longer duration of hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The additional stage this study uncovered, and which other studies have also uncovered, preparation, highlights the need for adequate guidance for adults who are yet to seek help for their hearing. The fact that very few people were in the action stage (approximately 3% of the sample) signals that screening alone is unlikely to be enough to improve help-seeking and rehabilitation rates. As expected, people in the later stages of change reported significantly greater hearing disability. The lack of significant relationships between stages-of-change measures and speech-in-noise recognition threshold and self-reported duration of hearing disability highlights the complex interplay between impairment, disability, and behaviors in adults who have failed an online hearing screening and who are yet to seek help.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=109770478&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,109770478,75,36,1,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM25158981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: Two hundred ninety-seven adults (182 women, 115 men) from rural areas, urban clusters, and an urban city of west Central Alabama completed a hearing assessment, a physical health questionnaire, a hearing handicap measure, and a visual memory test. Results: A greater number of adults with hearing loss lived in rural areas and urban clusters than in an urban area. In addition, poorer physical health was significantly associated with hearing loss. A greater number of individuals with poor physical health who lived in rural towns and urban clusters had hearing loss compared with the adults with other physical health issues who lived in an urban city. Poorer hearing sensitivity resulted in poorer outcomes on the Emotional and Social subscales of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults. And last, visual memory, a workingmemory task, was not associated with hearing loss but was associated with educational level. Conclusions: The outcomes suggest that hearing loss is associated with poor physical and emotional health but not with visual-memory skills. A greater number of adults living in rural areas experienced hearing loss compared with adults living in an urban city, and consequently, further research will be necessary to confirm this relationship and to explore the reasons behind it.

Treatment relies on the accurate diagnosis of hearing loss; however, this first step is out of reach for >80% of those affected. Increasingly automated approaches are being developed for self-administered digital hearing assessments without the direct involvement of professionals.Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of digital approaches in automated and machine learning assessments of hearing using pure-tone audiometry and to focus on the aspects related to accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency. This review is an extension of a 2013 systematic review.Methods: A search across the electronic databases of PubMed, IEEE, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant reports from the peer-reviewed literature. Key information about each report's scope and details was collected to assess the commonalities among the approaches.Results: A total of 56 reports from 2012 to June 2021 were included. From this selection, 27 unique automated approaches were identified. Machine learning approaches require fewer trials than conventional threshold-seeking approaches, and personal digital devices make assessments more affordable and accessible. Validity can be enhanced using digital technologies for quality surveillance, including noise monitoring and detecting inconclusive results.Conclusions: In the past 10 years, an increasing number of automated approaches have reported similar accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency as manual hearing assessments. New developments, including machine learning approaches, offer features, versatility, and cost-effectiveness beyond manual audiometry. Used within identified limitations, automated assessments using digital devices can support task-shifting, self-care, telehealth, and clinical care pathways.",Academic Journal,research,systematic review,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=155497014&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,155497014,79,24,2,"Toronto, Ontario",,,,,,,pmid,NLM34919056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design: Views and experiences of 32 participants from two participant groups informed this study: (a) a tinnitus group, consisting of adults who had experienced tinnitus during childhood and/or adolescence and primary carers of children/ adolescents with tinnitus, and (b) a clinicians’ group, consisting of clinicians who provided care for children/adolescents with tinnitus. Participants produced statements describing aspects of children/adolescents’ lives that may be affected by chronic tinnitus. Key concepts were identified through the processes of sorting the statements and rating them for degree of associated impact. Result: Participants identified 118 unique aspects of the lives of children/adolescents who may be affected by chronic tinnitus. These were clustered into four concepts: (a) emotional well-being, (b) academic performances, (c) social/relations, and (d) auditory/cognitive processing. At a group level, participants rated the impact of tinnitus as above a slight degree but below a moderate degree of impact. However, individual participant’s ratings indicated a range of perceived impact for each statement. Conclusions: The experience of chronic tinnitus during childhood and adolescence extends beyond the mere perception of sound. The perception of tinnitus may impact a child’s emotional well-being, academic performances, social/relational, and auditory/cognitive processing. The impact of tinnitus in one aspect of a child’s life may influence other aspects of their life. While at a group level, participants regarded the impact of tinnitus as “somewhat more than mild” to “less than moderate”; individual participant’s ratings indicate that the impact from chronic tinnitus may be highly individual and highlighted the importance of individual assessment and management. Clinically, tinnitus management during childhood and adolescence may be improved if clinicians consider the impact and manifestation of tinnitus within each child’s daily life and tailor tinnitus education and management strategies accordingly.",Academic Journal,pictorial,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=152784228&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,152784228,80,30,,"Rockville, Maryland",minor,Funding Source,age,Child: 6-12 years,age,Adolescent: 13-18 years,,,age,Adult: 19-44 years,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,gender,Female,gender,Male,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight participants were bilateral CI users and were tested in both ears. As a result, a total of 80 ears were tested in this study. All participants used Cochlear Nucleus CIs in their test ears. For each participant, the CN refractory recovery function and input/output (I/O) function were measured using electrophysiological measures of the electrically evoked compound action potential (eCAP) at three electrode sites across the electrode array. Refractory recovery time constants were estimated using statistical modeling with an exponential decay function. Slopes of I/O functions were estimated using linear regression. The eCAP parameters used as input variables in the predictive model were absolute refractory recovery time estimated based on the refractory recovery function, eCAP threshold, slope of the eCAP I/O function, and negative-peak (i.e., N1) latency. The output variable of the predictive model was CN index, an indicator for the functional status of the CN. Predictive models were created by performing linear regression, support vector machine regression, and logistic regression with eCAP parameters from children with CND and the children with NSCNs. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis with Tukey's honest significant difference criterion was used to compare study variables among study groups.Results: All three machine learning algorithms created two distinct distributions of CN indices for children with CND and children with NSCNs. Variations in CN index when calculated using different machine learning techniques were observed for adult CI users. Regardless of these variations, CN indices calculated using all three techniques in adult CI users were significantly correlated with Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant word and AzBio sentence scores measured in quiet. The five oldest CI users had smaller CN indices than the five youngest CI users in this study.Conclusions: The functional status of the CN for individual CI users was estimated by our newly developed analytical models. Model predictions of CN function for individual adult CI users were positively and significantly correlated with speech perception performance.

Study Design: Postoperative monosyllabic word recognition scores (WRS) served as the dependent variable to predict. Predictors included duration of deafness, duration of auditory deprivation (duration of deafness without hearing aid use), age at implantation, preoperative hearing threshold and monosyllabic WRS in quiet. Patients: Postlingually deaf adults (n = 120) who received CI, which was fully inserted, without any inner ear abnormalities or combined disabilities and with follow-up of more than 2 years. Methods: The prediction accuracy was evaluated with the mean absolute error (MAE) as well as the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the true WRS and predicted WRS. To determine the importance of predictors, we measured increase in the MAE when a given variable was omitted in the regression model relative to when it was included. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation to avoid bias related to inclusion of the test data into the training procedure. Results: The fitting of GLMs resulted in prediction performance with correlation coefficient r=0.7 and MAE of 15.6+/-9.5). On the other hand, the RFR machine learning yielded superior prediction performance to the GLM with r=0.96 and MAE of 6.1+/-4.7 (t=9.8; p<0.00001). Computation of the importance showed that the contribution of DAD to the prediction was the highest (MAE increase when omitted: 12.1), followed by duration of deafness (8.6) and AgeCI (8.3). In a subsequent analysis, a subgroup of patients with DAD ≤ 10 years showed higher postCI WRS and smaller variation than those with DAD > 10 years. Conclusion: The current study on clinical utility of machine learning on auditory outcomes of CIs in postlingually deaf adults demonstrated that an advanced nonlinear classifier yields a highly accurate prediction ability with an error of +/-6 in WRS. Our finding also suggests that CI should be implemented no later than a sensitive period (10 years) after deafness to lead to successful outcome. Finally, our machine learning technique has the potential for patient counseling and predicting benefit from CI to patients.",Academic Journal,abstract,proceedings,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=131274684&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,131274684,83,8,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant difficulty faced by the audiologists is in effective programming of hearing aids to provide enhanced satisfaction to the users. The main aim of our study was to develop a software intelligent system (SIS): (i) to perform the required audiological investigations for finding the degree and type of hearing loss, and (ii) to suggest appropriate values of hearing aid parameters for enhancing the speech intelligibility and the satisfaction level among the hearing aid users. In this paper, we present a Neuro-Fuzzy based SIS to automatically predict and suggest the hearing-aid parameters such as gain values, compression ratio and threshold knee point, which are needed to be fixed for different octave frequencies of sound inputs during the hearing-aid trial. The test signals for audiological investigations are generated through the standard hardware present in a personal computer system and with the aid of a software algorithm. The proposed system was validated with 243 subjects’ data collected at the Government General Hospital, Chennai, India. The calculated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the proposed audiometer incorporated in the SIS were 98.6%, 96.4 and 98.2%, respectively, by comparing its interpretations with those of the ‘gold standard’ audiometers. Furthermore, 91% (221 of 243) of the hearing impaired subjects attained satisfaction in the first hearing aid trials itself with the gain values as recommended by the improved SIS. The proposed system reduced around 75% of the ‘trial and error’ time spent by audiologists for enhancing satisfactory usage of the hearing aid. Hence, the proposed SIS could be used to find the degree and type of hearing loss and to recommend hearing aid parameters to provide optimal solutions to the hearing aid users.",Academic Journal,equations & formulas,glossary,pictorial,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=130627132&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,130627132,84,42,7,", <Blank>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,questionnaire/scale,research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tables/charts,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many different procedures have been proposed for measuring thresholds with pure tones by systematically manipulating intensity one frequency at a time until a discrete threshold function is determined. The authors have developed a novel nonparametric approach for estimating a continuous threshold audiogram using Bayesian estimation and machine learning classification. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of this new method relative to a commonly used threshold measurement technique.Design: The authors performed air conduction pure-tone audiometry on 21 participants between the ages of 18 and 90 years with varying degrees of hearing ability. Two repetitions of automated machine learning audiogram estimation and one repetition of conventional modified Hughson-Westlake ascending-descending audiogram estimation were acquired by an audiologist. The estimated hearing thresholds of these two techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz).Results: The two threshold estimate methods delivered very similar estimates at standard audiogram frequencies. Specifically, the mean absolute difference between estimates was 4.16 ± 3.76 dB HL. The mean absolute difference between repeated measurements of the new machine learning procedure was 4.51 ± 4.45 dB HL. These values compare favorably with those of other threshold audiogram estimation procedures. Furthermore, the machine learning method generated threshold estimates from significantly fewer samples than the modified Hughson-Westlake procedure while returning a continuous threshold estimate as a function of frequency.Conclusions: The new machine learning audiogram estimation technique produces continuous threshold audiogram estimates accurately, reliably, and efficiently, making it a strong candidate for widespread application in clinical and research audiometry.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=110930410&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,110930410,86,36,6,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM26258575,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both conditions can result from many different mechanisms, and as a consequence, patients may report a vast repertoire of associated symptoms and comorbidities that can reduce dramatically the quality of life and even lead to suicide attempts in the most severe cases. The present exploratory study is aimed at investigating patients' symptoms and complaints using an in-depth statistical analysis of patients' natural narratives in a real-life environment in which, thanks to the anonymization of contributions and the peer-to-peer interaction, it is supposed that the wording used is totally free of any self-limitation and self-censorship.Methods: We applied a purely statistical, non-supervised machine learning approach to the analysis of patients' verbatim exchanged on an Internet forum. After automated data extraction, the dataset has been preprocessed in order to make it suitable for statistical analysis. We used a variant of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to reveal clusters of symptoms and complaints of HA patients (topics). The probability of distribution of words within a topic uniquely characterizes it. The convergence of the log-likelihood of the LDA-model has been reached after 2,000 iterations. Several statistical parameters have been tested for topic modeling and word relevance factor within each topic.Results: Despite a rather small dataset, this exploratory study demonstrates that patients' free speeches available on the Internet constitute a valuable material for machine learning and statistical analysis aimed at categorizing ST/HA complaints. The LDA model with K = 15 topics seems to be the most relevant in terms of relative weights and correlations with the capability to individualizing subgroups of patients displaying specific characteristics. The study of the relevance factor may be useful to unveil weak but important signals that are present in patients' narratives.Discussion/conclusion: We claim that the LDA non-supervised approach would permit to gain knowledge on the patterns of ST- and HA-related complaints and on patients' centered domains of interest. The merits and limitations of the LDA algorithms are compared with other natural language processing methods and with more conventional methods of qualitative analysis of patients' output. Future directions and research topics emerging from this innovative algorithmic analysis are proposed.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=144711701&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,144711701,87,25,4,,,,,,,,pmid,NLM32062654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two specific aims for this research were (1) to describe the audiometric and clinical characteristics of children identified with slight-mild bilateral SNHL and (2) to compare children with slight-mild SNHL with those with normal hearing (NH) with respect to potential risk factors for congenital or acquired for hearing loss. DESIGN: A cross-sectional cluster sample survey of 6581 children enrolled in years 1 and 5 of Australian elementary school was completed. Children were screened for slight-mild SNHL, defined as a low- and/or high-frequency pure-tone average of 16 to 40 dB HL in the better ear, with air-bone gaps <10 dB. Children who did not pass the screen received air and bone conduction threshold and tympanometry tests to determine the type and degree of hearing loss. The parents of every child who participated in this study completed a questionnaire, before the hearing screening, to ascertain possible risk indicators. The questionnaire included items regarding the family's demographics, hearing status of family members, the presence of risk factors, and parental concern regarding the child's hearing. RESULTS: Fifty-five children with slight-mild SNHL and 5490 with NH were identified. Of the group with SNHL, 39 children had a slight loss (16 to 25 dB HL) and 16 had a mild loss (26 to 40 dB HL). The majority of the losses were bilateral and symmetrical, and the mean pure-tone average for the better ear for all 55 children was 22.4 dB HL (SD, 5.2). The most prevalent risk factor was 'neonatal intensive care unit/special care nursery admission,' which was reported for 12.5% of the SNHL and 8.4% of the NH group. Reported use of personal stereos was a significant risk factor with an odds ratio of 1.7 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 3.0, p = 0.05). The questions relating to parental concern for their child's hearing had low sensitivity (<30%) and very low positive predictive values (<3%) for detecting slight-mild SNHL. CONCLUSIONS: Slight-mild SNHL had a prevalence of 0.88% among the school-aged population sampled, with the majority of these children exhibiting bilateral, symmetrical audiometric configurations. Conventional risk factors for hearing loss were not strongly predictive of slight-mild SNHL nor were parental concerns about the child's hearing ability.

DPOAE and noise levels were measured at f2 frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz, and for primary levels (L1/L2) of 65/50 dB SPL and 75/75 dB SPL. Measurement-based stopping rules were used such that a test did not terminate unless the response was at least 3 dB above the mean noise floor + 2 SDs (SNR) for at least four of five test frequencies. The test would terminate, however, if these criteria were not met after 360 sec. Baby state, test environment, and other test factors were captured at the time of each test.Results: DPOAE levels, noise levels and SNRs were similar for well babies without risk indicators, well babies with risk indicators, and NICU graduates. There was a tendency for larger responses at f2 frequencies of 1.5 and 2.0 Hz, compared with 3.0 and 4.0 kHz; however, the noise levels systematically decreased as frequency increased, resulting in the most favorable SNRs at 3.0 and 4.0 kHz. Response levels were least and noise levels highest for an f2 frequency of 1.0 kHz. In addition, test time to achieve automatic stopping criteria was greatest for 1.0 kHz. With the exception of ""active/alert"" and ""crying"" babies, baby state had little influence on DPOAE measurements. Additionally, test environment had little impact on these measurements, at least for the environments in which babies were tested in this study. However, the lowest SNRs were observed for infants who were tested in functioning isolettes. Finally, there were some subtle age affects on DPOAE levels, with the infants born most prematurely producing the smallest responses, regardless of age at the time of test.Conclusions: DPOAE measurements in neonates and infants result in robust responses in the vast majority of ears for f2 frequencies of at least 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 kHz. SNRs decrease as frequency decreases, making the measurements less reliable at 1.0 kHz. When considered along with test time, there may be little justification for including an f2 frequency at 1.0 kHz in newborn screening programs. It would appear that DPOAEs result in reliable measurements when tests are conducted in the environments in which babies typically are found. Finally, these data suggest that babies can be tested in those states of arousal that are most commonly encountered in the perinatal period.",Academic Journal,clinical trial,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=107029174&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,107029174,90,21,5,"Baltimore, Maryland",minor,Female,minor,"Infant, Newborn",minor,Infant,pmid,NLM11059701,minor,Inpatients,minor,"Hospitals, Pediatric",minor,Academic Medical Centers,minor,Human,age,"Infant, Newborn:  birth-1 month",age,Infant: 1-23 months,Journal Article,,gender,Male,gender,Female,,,,,,"Gorga, M P","Norton, S J","Sininger, Y S","Cone-Wesson, B","Folsom, R C","Vohr, B R","Widen, J E","Neely, S T",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates from the rural county were based on Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS) data collected from 892 women and 750 men between 1994 and 1998.Data Collection and Analysis: Cluster analyses (k-means) were used to divide participants into groups including maximally similar bilateral air conduction audiograms. Separate cluster analyses were conducted for each gender. For NHANES data, prevalence and error estimates were obtained using sample weights intended to provide data generalizing to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States within this age range.Results: The hierarchical structure of audiometric configurations revealed that approximately 25% of women and 50% of men aged 20 to 69 in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States were best described by a configuration consistent with a marked hearing impairment in at least one frequency. Hearing impairments were more common among participants in the KCRHS. Gently sloping configurations of hearing impairment were dominant among women, while configurations featuring a greater slope were dominant among men.

Methods: This study was based on data collected during the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2010-2012). The study sample consisted of 5,447 Koreans aged ≥60 years who received a hearing assessment. Hearing loss was measured using a pure tone audiometry test and classified according to the World Health Organization's criteria. Hearing aid use was assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between hearing loss, hearing aid use, and related variables. Results: Hearing loss was found in 16.8% of the elders and only 15.9% of them used a hearing aid. Male (95% CI: 1.27-2.15), tinnitus (95% CI: 1.58-2.32), dizziness (95% CI: 1.05-1.73), and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.32-2.38) were the variables most strongly associated with hearing loss after multivariate adjustment. Tinnitus (95% CI: 1.34-4.13) and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.01-5.02) were strongly associated with hearing aid use after multivariate adjustment. Conclusion: More than half of South Korean elders aged ≥60 and older have hearing loss but the rate of hearing aid use is very low.

Data mining techniques have proved to be useful for knowledge discovery in this type of data and for supporting decision-making processes.Objectives: The overall objective is to classify time series based on the discovery of frequent patterns. These patterns will be discovered in symbolic sequences obtained from the time series data by means of a temporal abstraction process.Methods: Firstly, we transform numeric time series into symbolic time sequences, where the symbols aim to represent the relevant domain concepts. These symbols can be defined using either public or expert domain knowledge. Then we apply a symbolic pattern discovery technique to the output symbolic sequences. This technique identifies the subsequences frequently found in a population group. These subsequences (patterns) are representative of population groups. Finally, we employ a classification technique based on the identified patterns in order to classify new individuals. Thanks to the inclusion of domain knowledge, the classification results can be explained using domain terminology. This makes the results easier to interpret for the domain specialist (physician).Results: This method has been applied to brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) time series. Preliminary experiments were carried out to analyse several aspects of the method including the best configuration of the pattern discovery technique parameters. We then applied the method to the BAEPs of 83 individuals belonging to four classes (healthy, conductive hearing loss, vestibular schwannoma-brainstem involvement and vestibular schwannoma-8th-nerve involvement). According to the results of the cross-validation, overall accuracy was 99.4%, sensitivity (recall) was 97.6% and specificity was 100% (no false positives).Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces dimensionality. Additionally, if the symbolic transformation includes the right domain knowledge, the method arguably outputs a data representation that denotes the relevant domain concepts more clearly. The method is capable of finding patterns in BAEPs time series and is very accurate at correctly predicting whether or not new patients have an auditory-related disorder.",Academic Journal,Journal Article,,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=116862671&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,116862671,95,70,,,,,,,,,pmid,NLM27431034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify candidates, patient audiograms from one practice were exported into the screening module. Candidates were tracked to determine if any eventually underwent implantation.Results: After loading 4836 audiograms from the Noah 4 system, the screening module identified 558 potential CI candidates. After reviewing the data for the potential candidates, 117 were targeted and invited to an educational event. Following the event, a total of six candidates were evaluated, and two were implanted.Discussion: This objective approach to identifying candidates has the potential to address the gross underutilization of CIs by removing any bias or lack of knowledge regarding the management of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with CIs.Conclusion: The screening module was an effective tool for identifying potential CI candidates at one ENT practice.

Intraoperative electrically evoked auditory brain stem responses (EABRs) are recorded to assist in the placement of the electrode array over the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei in the lateral recess of the IVth ventricle of the brain stem. This study had four objectives: (1) to characterize EABRs evoked by stimulation with an ABI in adolescents and adults with NF2, (2) to evaluate how the EABR morphology relates to auditory sensations elicited from stimulation by an ABI, (3) to establish whether there is evidence of morphology changes in the EABR with site of stimulation by the ABI, and (4) to investigate how the threshold of the EABR relates to behavioral threshold and comfortably loud sensations measured at initial device activation. Design: Intraoperative EABRs were recorded from 34 subjects with ABIs: 19 male and 15 female, mean age 27 yrs (range 12 to 52 yrs). ABI stimulation was applied at seven different sites using either wide bipolar stimulation across the array or in subsections of the array from medial to lateral and inferior to superior. The EABRs were analyzed with respect to morphology, peak latency, and changes in these characteristics with the site of stimulation. In a subset of eight subjects, additional narrow bipolar sites were stimulated to compare the intraoperative EABR threshold levels with the behavioral threshold (T) and comfortably loud (C) levels of stimulation required at initial device activation. Results: EABRs were elicited from 91% of subjects. Morphology varied from one to four vertex-positive peaks with mean latencies of 0.76, 1.53, 2.51, and 3.64 msecs, respectively. The presence of an EABR from stimulation by electrodes across the whole array had a high predictive value for the presence of auditory electrodes at initial device activation. When examining subsections of the array, the absence of an EABR was a poor predictor for the absence of auditory electrodes. The morphology of the EABRs varied with site of stimulation in 16 cases, but there was no consistent pattern of change with stimulation site. There was a trend for more auditory electrodes to be present in stimulation sites that evoked EABRs with a higher number of peaks in the waveform. The EABR threshold was closer to the behavioral C level than the T level, but there was no overall correlation between the intraoperative EABR threshold level and the behavioral T and C levels. Conclusions: The presence of an intraoperative EABR corresponded well to the presence of auditory electrodes. The absence of an EABR from stimulating subsections of the array was not; however, a good indicator for the absence of auditory electrodes and the EABR from such stimulation would not be of assistance in identifying the nonauditory sections of the array to exclude in behavioral fitting of the device. The morphology of the EABR did not relate to site of stimulation. More peaks in the EABR was associated with a greater number of electrodes with auditory sensations, suggesting that correct positioning of the ABI activated more auditory subsystems within the cochlear nucleus. The intraoperative EABR thresholds did not correlate with the behavioral T and C levels and could not be used to assist in device fitting.",Academic Journal,pictorial,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=104901966&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,104901966,97,32,3,"Baltimore, Maryland",minor,United Kingdom,minor,Waveforms,age,Adolescent: 13-18 years,pmid,NLM21157353,age,Adult: 19-44 years,age,Child: 6-12 years,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,gender,Female,gender,Male,,,tracings,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas hearing aids improve speech recognition in quiet, their performance in noisy environment have not been clearly evaluated. Here, we investigate the benefit of wearing hearing aid using a data base of 30,000 subjects. Specifically, we compared aided speech performance of subjects in quiet and noisy backgrounds using deep learning algorithms. Material and methods: Subjects from 40 to 109 years old (78±7 years old, mean±SD) with a bilateral symmetric hearing loss were included in the study. Patients were fitted between 2017 and 2021 with standardized protocols realized in 700 Amplifon hearing care centers distributed all over France. Hearing assessments were performed using a pure tone audiometry (PTA) from 125 Hz to 8 kHz. Speech-in-quiet (dissyllabic words presented in free field) and a speech-in-noise recognition tests (HINT sentences in free field, masking noise at 65 dB HL, adaptative procedure) were performed to assess the aided speech performance of subjects. The data were anonymized, centralized, and stored on secure data server. Data processing was carried out using R statistical software. Results: The 30,000 patients were partitioned (k-means algorithm, Euclidean distance, 1000 iterations) in 200 clusters according to their pure-tone audiogram. A positive and significant linear relationship was found between aided pure tone threshold in quiet and the mean PTA threshold at frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Positive linear relationship was also found between aided speech performance in quiet and mean PTA threshold. When evaluating the aided speech performance in noise, the correlation was reduced especially in subjects with a mean PTA threshold below 50 dB HL (i.e. mild and moderate hearing loss). Note that hearing aids provide a significant benefit in noise for patients with moderately severe and severe hearing loss (mean PTA threshold above 50 dB HL). Conclusions: Our results show that the use of hearing aids improves speech intelligibility both in quiet and noisy environments for people with moderately severe to severe hearing loss. For people with mild to moderate hearing loss, hearing aids improve mostly the speech intelligibility in quiet.",Academic Journal,abstract,proceedings,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=156437959&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,156437959,99,12,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor soundscapes have been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). We evaluated the effect of the Mobile Soundscape Appraisal and Recording Technology sound awareness intervention (MoSART+) on NPS in nursing home residents with dementia. A 15-month, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial. Every 3 months, a nursing home switched from care as usual to the use of the intervention. The 3-month MoSART+ intervention involved ambassador training, staff performing sound measurements with the MoSART application, meetings, and implementation of microinterventions. The goal was to raise awareness about soundscapes and their influence on residents. We included 110 residents with dementia in 5 Dutch nursing homes. Exclusion criteria were palliative sedation and deafness. The primary outcome was NPS severity measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) by the resident's primary nurse. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (QUALIDEM), psychotropic drug use (ATC), staff workload (workload questionnaire), and staff job satisfaction (Maastricht Questionnaire of Job Satisfaction). The mean age of the residents (n = 97) at enrollment was 86.5 ± 6.7 years, and 76 were female (76.8%). The mean NPI-NH score was 17.5 ± 17.3. One nursing home did not implement the intervention because of staff shortages. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a clinically relevant reduction in NPS between the study groups (−8.0, 95% CI –11.7, −2.6). There was no clear effect on quality of life [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI –0.7, 6.3], psychotropic drug use (1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.7), staff workload (−0.3, 95% CI –0.3, 0.8), or staff job satisfaction (−0.2, 95% CI –1.2, 0.7). MoSART+ empowered staff to adapt the local soundscape, and the intervention effectively reduced staff-reported levels of NPS in nursing home residents with dementia. Nursing homes should consider implementing interventions to improve the soundscape.",Academic Journal,research,randomized controlled trial,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=161556173&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,161556173,101,24,2,"New York, New York",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zuidema, Sytse U.","Luijendijk, Hendrika J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the second part of this study, the number of SSQ items was reduced to five to make this questionnaire available for routine usage in clinical settings and for screening purposes. METHODS: : SSQ responses derived from 103 normal-hearing 18- to 25-year-old persons were compared with the SSQ responses of 24 clinically normal-hearing (all thresholds between 125 and 8000 Hz <=25 dB HL) and 109 healthy, 55- to 65-year-old persons with age-related hearing impairment to determine the prevalence and profile of hearing disability. The 45 items of the SSQ were reduced to five by cluster analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. The robustness of this five-item version (SSQ5) was determined in three control populations: an adult 25- to 55-year-old population (n = 159), an ENT-patient population (n = 60), and a population of hearing aid candidates (n = 50). The feasibility of the SSQ5 for screening was compared with the feasibility of the simple question 'Do you have hearing loss?' by determining, respectively, the sensitivity, specificity, and maximum achievable discriminatory power for predicting hearing status according to speech-in-noise performance. RESULTS: : Prevalence numbers showed data of healthy, middle-aged persons with significant disability, despite minimal impairment (25%) versus data of middle-aged persons with significant impairment and nevertheless, minimal disability (61%). The profile of hearing disability seemed similar in all normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subgroups (i.e., most problems with understanding speech especially in noise conditions, and least problems with sound quality). Compared with the single question: 'Do you have hearing loss?' the use of the SSQ5 had 37% more maximum discriminatory power for determining hearing status category based on speech-in-noise performance in 55- to 65-year-old persons. In addition, the SSQ5 seemed robust in adult populations of different ages (89.6% correlation between the answers of the SSQ5 and SSQ45), as well as in ENT-patient populations (93.7% correlation) and hearing aid candidate populations (79.2% correlation). CONCLUSIONS: : The results of this study suggest that disability measures and measures for hearing impairment cannot replace each other, but are complementary. Therefore, it is advised to implement both disability measures and impairment measures in screening and referral policies for hearing loss. To get a first impression of hearing disability, our results suggest that it is useful to ask five disability questions (SSQ5) instead of one general question like 'Do you have hearing loss?'",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=108082596&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,108082596,102,33,5,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM22568994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for 14 unmedicated, right-handed patients and 35 healthy control subjects, we investigated whether functional hearing loss was associated with discernible changes of brain morphology. Group differences in gray matter volume (GMV) were assessed using high-resolution, T1-weighted, volumetric MR imaging datasets (3T Trio scanner; Siemens AG) and analyzed with covariant factors of age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and total GMV, which was increased by 27.9% in the left medial frontal gyrus (MFG) (Brodmann area 10) (p=.001, corrected cluster level) and by 14.4% in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the adjacent middle temporal gyrus (MTG) (BA42 to 21) (p=.009, corrected cluster level) in patients with pseudohypacusis. The GMV in the right STG (BA42) and verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) were correlated significantly with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III) (ß=-.57, p<.0001) and level of SES (ß=-.55, p<.0001).

It is now widely accepted that early implantation leads to better postimplant outcomes. Although some generalizations can be made about postimplant auditory and language performance, neural mechanisms need to be studied to predict individual prognosis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify preimplant neuroimaging biomarkers that predict children's postimplant auditory and language outcomes as measured by parental observation/reports. Research Design: This is a pre--post correlational measures study. Study Sample: Twelve possible cochlear implant candidates with bilateral severe to profound hearing loss were recruited via referrals for a clinical magnetic resonance imaging to ensure structural integrity of the auditory nerve for implantation. Intervention: Participants underwent cochlear implantation at a mean age of 19.4 mo. All children used the advanced combination encoder strategy (ACE, Cochlear Corporation™, Nucleus® Freedom cochlear implants). Three participants received an implant in the right ear; one in the left ear whereas eight participants received bilateral implants. Participants' preimplant neuronal activation in response to two auditory stimuli was studied using an event-related fMRI method. Data Collection and Analysis: Blood oxygen level dependent contrast maps were calculated for speech and noise stimuli. The general linear model was used to create z-maps. The Auditory Skills Checklist (ASC) and the SKI-HI Language Development Scale (SKI-HI LDS) were administered to the parents 2 yr after implantation. A nonparametric correlation analysis was implemented between preimplant fM RI activation and postimplant auditory and language outcomes based on ASC and SKI-HI LDS. Statistical Parametric Mapping software was used to create regression maps between fMRI activation and scores on the aforementioned tests. Regression maps were overlaid on the Imaging Research Center infant template and visualized in MRlcro. Results: Regression maps revealed two clusters of brain activation for the speech versus silence contrast and five clusters for the noise versus silence contrast that were significantly correlated with the parental reports. These clusters included auditory and extra-auditory regions such as the middle temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, subgyral, and middle occipital gyrus. Both positive and negative correlations were observed. Correlation values for the different clusters ranged from -0.90 to 0.95 and were significant at a corrected p value of <0.05. Correlations suggest that postimplant performance may be predicted by activation in specific brain regions. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that (1) fMRI can be used to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of auditory and language performance before implantation and (2) activation in certain brain regions may be predictive of postimplant auditory and language performance as measured by parental observation/reports.",Academic Journal,diagnostic images,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=133484005&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,133484005,104,29,5,"New York, New York",gender,Male,gender,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study sample: Twenty-one participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 15 completed training and audiological testing and eight completed the MRI portion of the study. Results: Scores on tinnitus-related questionnaires showed a significant decline either from pre- to post-intervention or from pre-intervention to follow-up, despite no significant change during baseline. Voxel-based morphometric analysis of the structural MRI scans revealed clusters in bilateral superior frontal gyrus that exhibited significant increases in grey matter volume over the period of intervention and follow-up. Further, grey matter changes in occipital and cingulate regions correlated with declines in tinnitus handicap. Conclusions: This pilot study supports MBCT as an adequate approach for treating distressing tinnitus and suggests that neuroanatomical changes may reflect reductions in tinnitus-related severity.

Study design:The study was conducted in three different phases. The Kannada low frequency wordlists were developed in Phase I. The procedure involved collecting bi-syllabic familiar words, recording them, selecting the words dominant in low frequency energy by acoustical (Fast Fourier) transform and statistical means (k-means clustering) then generating equivalent wordlists using psychometric function. In Phase II, all the wordlists developed were standardized through estimation of speech identification scores in 100 individuals with normal hearing and through re-verification of equivalence of wordlists’ difficulty level by obtaining psychometric function. Finally, during Phase III, lists developed were evaluated for usefulness by administering them along with conventional phonemically-balanced Kannada wordlist on 10 individuals with cochlear hearing loss having rising audiometric configurations (i.e. more loss at lower frequencies). Results:Phase I resulted in development of seven psychometrically equivalent wordlists. Speech identification scores on 100 individuals with normal hearing showed mean scores greater than 95% for all the lists at 40 dB SL. No statistical difference was noted across wordlists. Further, individuals with rising cochlear hearing loss (RCHL) performed significantly poorer when compared to normal hearing counterparts across wordlists except low frequency wordlist 4 and phonemically balanced wordlist. Conclusions:The study utilized a unique procedure for the development of wordlists which can serve as guidelines for further research. The study has resulted in standardization (along with generation of normative data) and successful validation of the lists (except list 4) developed on a clinical population, i.e. individuals with RCHL.

Functional imaging was carried out to test the hypothesis that musical hallucinosis is due to activity within such a module, for which the neural substrate is a distributed network distinct from the primary auditory cortex. PET was carried out on the six subjects to identify areas where brain activity increased as a function of the severity of the hallucination. In a group analysis, no effect was demonstrated in the primary auditory cortices. Clusters of correlated activity were demonstrated in the posterior temporal lobes, the right basal ganglia, the cerebellum and the inferior frontal cortices. This network is similar to that previously demonstrated during the normal perception and imagery of patterned-segmented sound, and is consistent with the proposed neuropsychological and neural mechanism.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=136570990&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,136570990,108,123,10,,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,age,Aged: 65+ years,gender,Female,,,gender,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fitting the ABI for these new candidates presents a challenge, and intraoperative electrically evoked auditory brain stem responses (EABRs) may assist in the surgical placement of the electrode array over the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus in the brain stem and in the postoperative programming of the device. This study had four objectives: (1) to characterize the EABR by stimulation of the cochlear nucleus in children, (2) to establish whether there are any changes between the EABR recorded intraoperatively and again just before initial behavioral testing with the device, (3) to establish whether there is evidence of morphology changes in the EABR depending on the site of stimulation with the ABI, and (4) to investigate how the EABR relates to behavioral measurements and the presence of auditory and nonauditory sensations perceived with the ABI at initial device activation. Design: Intra- and postoperative EABRs were recorded from six congenitally deaf children with ABIs, four boys and two girls, mean age 4.2 yrs (range 3.2 to 5.0 yrs). The ABI was stimulated at nine different bipolar sites on the array, and the EABRs recorded were analyzed with respect to the morphology and peak latency with site of stimulation for each recording session. The relationship between the EABR waveforms and the presence or absence of auditory electrodes at initial device activation was investigated. The EABR threshold levels were compared with the behavioral threshold (T) and comfortably loud (C) levels of stimulation required at initial device activation. Results: EABRs were elicited from all children on both test occasions. Responses contained a possible combination of one to three peaks from a total of four identifiable peaks with mean latencies of 1.04, 1.81, 2.61, and 3.58 msecs, respectively. The presence of an EABR was a good predictor of an auditory response; however, the absence of the EABR was poor at predicting a site with no auditory response. The morphology of EABRs often varied with site of stimulation and between EABR test occasions. Postoperatively, there was a trend for P1, P3, and P4 to be present at the lateral end of the array and P2 at the medial end of the array. Behavioral T and C levels showed a good correlation with postoperative EABR thresholds but a poor correlation with intraoperative EABR thresholds. Conclusions: The presence of an intraoperative EABR was a good indicator for the location of electrodes on the ABI array that provided auditory sensations. The morphology of the EABR was often variable within and between test sessions. The postoperative EABR thresholds did correlate with the behavioral T and C levels and could be used to assist with initial device fitting.",Academic Journal,pictorial,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=104901969&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,104901969,109,32,3,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM21150625,,,,,,,,,,,,,tracings,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Using the WHO Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and the probability proportion to size (PPS) sampling technique, 30,733 residents were targeted for investigation in 150 clusters in four provinces. Every subject had an ear examination and pure tone audiometry. Definitions of disabling hearing loss and the classification of hearing impairment used were in accordance with WHO recommendations. Results: Among 30,733 targeted residents, 29,246 individuals (95.2%) participated in the survey. One thousand, three hundred and sixty individuals (4.4%) were absent; 127 individuals (0.4%) refused. The prevalences of hearing impairment and disabling hearing impairment were 14.2% and 5.2% of investigated individuals, respectively: 9.1% of the sample had a mild hearing loss, 3.8% a moderate degree of hearing loss, 1.1% a severe and 0.3% a profound hearing loss. Using data from the fifth population census in China (2000), we calculated the standardized rates of hearing impairment and hearing disability in our study to be 11.7% and 4.4%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the prevalence between males and females, urban and rural dwellers, as well as for different ages. The prevalence of ear diseases was 6.5% of investigated individuals: the standardized rate was 5.9%; 0.2% of investigated individuals had auricle malformation, 2.2% impacted cerumen, 0.2% otitis externa, 0.3% fungi, 0.1% foreign body, 0.1% acute otitis media, 0.9% chronic suppurative otitis media, 1.8% serous otitis media and 1.3% dry perforation of tympanic membrane. Overall, 8.0% of investigated persons were assessed to be likely to benefit from hearing aids, while 4.0% of persons needed medication, 0.1% language/speech rehabilitation, 1.5% non-urgent surgery and 0.9% other treatment. Conclusions: The high prevalence of hearing impairment and disability is a heavy burden on social development and also hinders normal family life. The government and society as a whole should show more concern about these problems. Strategies for prevention and intervention should be focused on less developed regions, rural areas, aging people and non-infectious conditions.

Traditionally, these signature symptoms have pointed to some sort of pathology within the inner ear itself, but here the focus is shifted to the middle ear muscles. These muscles, the tensor tympani and the stapedius, have generally been seen as serving only a secondary protective role in hearing, but in this paper they are identified as vigilant gate-keepers - constantly monitoring acoustic input and dynamically adjusting hearing sensitivity so as to enhance external sounds and suppress internally generated ones. The case is made that this split-second adjustment is accomplished by regulation of inner ear pressure: when the middle ear muscles contract they push the stapes into the oval window and increase the pressure of fluids inside the otic capsule. In turn, hydraulic pressure squeezes hair cells, instantly adjusting their sensitivity. If the middle ear muscles should malfunction - such as from cramp, spasm, or dystonia - the resulting abnormal pressure will disrupt hair cells and produce Meniere's symptoms. A wide-ranging review of Meniere's disease and the middle ear muscles reinforces the link between the two. Since every striated muscle is prone to dystonia - an involuntary contraction involving derangement of its underlying control loop - middle ear muscle dystonia would lead to elevated pressure and abnormal hair cell function. The hypothesis is based on recognizing that the inner ear is a hydrostat - a cavity filled with fluid whose pressure is controlled by the middle ear muscles. Since the fluid is incompressible, even a slight contraction of the muscles can increase the pressure in the labyrinth to 3 kPa. The effect of such a pressure on the sensing cells within is crucial. Outer hair cells carry an internal turgor pressure of about 1 kPa, behaving physically like inflated balloons, and hence contraction of the middle ear muscles can instantly overcome internal cellular pressure, switch off ion channels, and reduce hearing sensitivity. This paper brings together supporting evidence and sets out major implications for Meniere's disease, including possible treatments.",Academic Journal,pictorial,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=127587521&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,127587521,111,7,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dentro del grupo de los síntomas del síndrome de Méniére pueden diferenciarse: vértigo, pérdida progresiva de la audición, acúfenos en el rango de frecuencias bajas, sensación de presión en los oídos. Los síntomas antes mencionados, característicos de esta enfermedad, tradicionalmente se han asociado a cierta patología dentro del oído medio, en este caso se pone hincapié sobre los músculos del oído medio. Dichos músculos - el músculo tensor del tímpano y el músculo tensor del estribo - se percibían hasta ahora como unos que cumplen la función protectora del aparato auditivo de forma meramente secundaria, sin embargo en este artículo se reconocen como controladores que vigilan constantemente los estímulos acústicos y reajustan de forma dinámica la sensibilidad auditiva con el fin de reforzar los sonidos externos y atenuar los generados internamente. En el caso mencionado, el ajuste inmediato se realiza regulando la presión en el oído interno; cuando los músculos del oído medio se contraen, empujan el estribo hacia la ventana oval y causan el aumento de presión del líquido dentro del laberinto. Por su parte, la presión hidráulica reduce el diámetro de los capilares, ajustando de manera constante su sensibilidad. Si los músculos del oído medio experimentan problemas con un funcionamiento correcto - por ejemplo aparecen contracciones, espasmos o distonía - los capilares se deterioran a consecuencia de esa presión atípica, lo cual conduce a la aparición de los síntomas del síndrome de Méniére. Observando de forma integral el síndrome de Méniére y los músculos de oído medio se puede reafirmar la relación que existe entre ellos. Como cada músculo estriado es susceptible a la distonía - las contracciones involuntarias por trastornos del principal bucle de control - la distonía de los músculos del oído medio causaría una presión elevada y el funcionamiento incorrecto de los capilares. La hipótesis se basa en el reconocimiento del hecho de que el oído medio es un presostato: una cavidad rellena de líquido cuya presión viene controlada por los músculos del oído medio. Como el líquido es incompresible, incluso una contracción minúscula de los músculos puede aumentar la presión dentro del laberinto óseo hasta do 3 kPa. El impacto de esa presión dentro de los capilares es crítico. Los capilares externos que mantienen la turgencia a nivel de lkPa se comportan como unos globos hinchados, por tanto la contracción de los músculos del oído medio puede rápidamente superar la turgencia, desactivar los canales iónicos y reducir la sensibilidad auditiva. El presente trabajo relaciona las pruebas científicas existentes y presenta las principales causas del síndrome de Méniére, así como las posibilidades de su tratamiento.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"W zespole objawów choroby Meniere'a można wyróżnić: zawroty głowy, postępujący ubytek słuchu, szumy uszne o niskich częstotliwościach, uczucie ciśnienia w uchu. Tradycyjnie powyższe charakterystyczne objawy wskazywały na pewną patologię w obrębie ucha środkowego, w tym przypadku kładzie się nacisk na mięśniach ucha środkowego. Mięśnie te - napinacz błony bębenkowej oraz strzemiączkowy - były do tej pory postrzegane jako pełniące jedynie drugorzędną rolę ochronną narządu słuchu, jednak w tym artykule zostają rozpoznane jako czujni kontrolerzy, stale monitorujący bodźce akustyczne i dynamicznie dostosowujący wrażliwość słuchową w celu wzmocnienia zewnętrznych dźwięków i stłumienia wytwarzanych wewnętrznie. W powyższym przypadku błyskawiczne dostosowanie następuje poprzez regulację ciśnienia w uchu wewnętrznym - gdy mięśnie ucha środkowego kurczą się, wypychają strzemiączko do okienka owalnego i zwiększają ciśnienie płynów wewnątrz błędnika. Z kolei ciśnienie hydrauliczne zwęża naczynia włosowate, nieustannie dostosowując ich wrażliwość. Jeśli mięśnie ucha środkowego mają problemy z prawidłowym funkcjonowaniem - np. przez skurcze, spazmy czy dystonię, naczynia włosowate zostaną uszkodzone w następstwie nietypowego ciśnienia, co doprowadzi do pojawienia się objawów choroby Manierea. Kompleksowa obserwacja choroby Manierea oraz mięśni ucha środkowego wzmacnia związek między nimi. Jako, że każdy mięsień prążkowany jest podatny na dystonię - mimowolne skurcze obejmujące zaburzenia ich podstawowej pętli regulacyjnej - dystonia mięśni ucha środkowego prowadziłaby do podniesionego ciśnienia i nieprawidłowego funkcjonowania naczyń włosowatych. Hipoteza opiera się na rozpoznaniu, że ucho wewnętrzne jest hydrostatem - wnęką wypełnioną płynem, którego ciśnienie jest kontrolowane przez mięśnie ucha środkowego. Ponieważ płyn jest nieściśliwy, nawet niewielki skurcz mięśni może zwiększyć ciśnienie w błędniku kostnym do 3 kPa. Wpływ takiego ciśnienia w obrębie naczyń włosowatych jest kluczowy. Zewnętrzne naczynia włosowate utrzymujące wewnątrzkomórkowe ciśnienie (turgor) na wysokości lkPa zachowują się jak napompowane balony, zatem skurcz mięśni ucha środkowego może błyskawicznie pokonać ciśnienie wewnątrzkomórkowe, wyłączyć kanały jonowe i zredukować wrażliwość słuchową. Niniejsza praca łączy istniejące dowody i prezentuje główne przyczyny choroby Meniere'a, w tym możliwe leczenie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, this study sought to create a new scale that is reliable, valid, brief, and easy to score with the purpose of filling this gap.Design: Original items were constructed through review of currently existing models of hyperacusis measurement, as well as qualitative data collected from professional audiologists and individuals reporting heightened audiological sensitivity with tinnitus. An initial 26-item scale yielded sound reliability and validity properties. Refinement based on review of initial data resulted in a 25-question second version with a maximum score of 100. A total of 450 completed survey protocols were analyzed from 469 refined Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS) administrations collected online, representing individuals from 37 countries with a mean age of 34.8 years.Results: Internal consistency reliability analysis yielded a Cronbach's α of 0.93, indicating excellent reliability. Furthermore, the IHS showed sound convergent validity with established measures of quality of life, anxiety, and depression in bivariate correlation analysis of Pearson's r. Factor analysis revealed a dimensional structure containing five factors, which were designated psychosocial impact, emotional arousal, functional impact, general loudness, and communication. Analysis of variance between perceived global hyperacusis severity categories provided a preliminary framework for scoring thresholds. Although the level of hearing loss did not correlate with IHS scores, increased tinnitus symptoms were a significant factor in predicting hyperacusis distress and severity.Conclusions: These initial results demonstrated sound statistical properties of the IHS and usefulness as a hyperacusis measurement tool in research and clinical practice. Factor structure and scale dimensions allow for differentiation between subtypes of loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain based on responses to clusters of specific items within the dimensional factor structure of the scale, and may thus prove useful in clinical practice and research.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=133604670&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,133604670,119,39,5,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM29742543,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients from rural regions may have many barriers to timely diagnosis and intervention. The purpose of this study was to examine the spatial and hospital-based distribution of failed infant hearing screening testing and pediatric congenital hearing loss throughout Kentucky.Design: Data on live births and audiological reporting of infant hearing loss results in Kentucky from 2009 to 2011 were analyzed. The authors used spatial scan statistics to identify high-rate clusters of failed newborn screening tests and permanent congenital hearing loss (PCHL), based on the total number of live births per county. The authors conducted further analyses on PCHL and failed newborn hearing screening tests, based on birth hospital data and method of screening.Results: The authors observed four statistically significant (p < 0.05) high-rate clusters with failed newborn hearing screenings in Kentucky, including two in the Appalachian region. Hospitals using two-stage otoacoustic emission testing demonstrated higher rates of failed screening (p = 0.009) than those using two-stage automated auditory brainstem response testing. A significant cluster of high rate of PCHL was observed in Western Kentucky. Five of the 54 birthing hospitals were found to have higher relative risk of PCHL, and two of those hospitals are located in a very rural region of Western Kentucky within the cluster.Conclusions: This spatial analysis in children in Kentucky has identified specific regions throughout the state with high rates of congenital hearing loss and failed newborn hearing screening tests. Further investigation regarding causative factors is warranted.

Radiation and platinum chemotherapy independently increase the risk of HL; however, combined modality treatment is routinely used and the effect of chemoradiation on HL risk is not well-studied. Using chemotherapy and cochlear radiation (RT) doses, we created a model that predicts for HL, including a nomogram that can be used in the clinical setting to calculate the risk of clinically-significant HL.Materials/methods: In this single institution retrospective study, 171 patients with H&N or CNS tumors were treated with radiation, with or without chemotherapy and had longitudinal (≥2) audiological evaluation. SIOP-Boston (SIOP) and Chang grades were assigned to 2,420 hearing assessments of 342 ears; analyses using SIOP grades are presented here. For the nomogram, SIOP grade ≥3 was considered clinically-significant HL (requiring hearing aids). An Andersen-Gill model for recurrent events was used to obtain inverse intensity weights to account for factors explaining the number of assessments. Multivariable weighted ordinal logistic regression was fitted to evaluate the effect of clinicopathologic features on HL. Clustered robust standard errors were calculated to account for intra-patient correlation.Results: Patients underwent a median of 6 (range 2-23) assessments over a median of 3.1 years from diagnosis to last audiogram (range 0.1-15.2 years). Cisplatin was given to 63% of patients and 34% received carboplatin. The mean cochlear doses on the right and left were 36.8 Gy (standard deviation [SD] 16.5) and 37.0 Gy (SD 16.2), respectively. Multivariable regression revealed that mean cochlear dose (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 per Gy, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.05, P < 0.001), time since RT (OR 1.2 per year, 95% CI 1.2-1.3, P < 0.001), cisplatin use (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.9-9.9, P < 0.001), and carboplatin use (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.27-4.17, P = 0.006) were associated with increasing SIOP grade of HL; age at RT, hydrocephalus, surgery, amifostine, and laterality were not correlated with HL. There was no synergistic effect of RT and cisplatin (interaction term, P = 0.4) or RT and carboplatin (interaction term, P = 0.9). Cumulative incidence of high-frequency HL (> 4 kHz) was > 50% at 5 years post-RT in those who received mean dose > 20 Gy to the cochlea, while incidence of HL across all frequencies continued to increase beyond 5 years post-RT.Conclusion: RT and chemotherapy have an additive, not synergistic, effect on HL risk. Mean cochlear radiation dose, time since radiation, and platinum chemotherapy use were associated with HL.

ReHo, fALFF, and seed-based FC were calculated and compared between ST patients and NCs. Meanwhile, correlation analyses were calculated between altered connectivity and clinical data in ST patients.Results: Compared with NCs, ST patients exhibited increased ReHo and fALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the ReHo values were also increased in the right cuneus. In contrast, decreased ReHo values in ST patients were observed in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left cerebellar anterior lobe. Considering these brain areas with altered ReHo and fALFF clusters as seeds, the right MTG (ReHo) exhibited decreased connectivity with the right MFG, lingual gyrus, and left cerebellar posterior lobe, besides, the right cuneus showed decreased connectivity with the right MTG. In ST patients, the decreased FC between the right MTG (ReHo) and the right MFG was also positively correlated with the Tinnitus handicap inventory score (r = 0.675, P = 0.001).Conclusion: The present study revealed that ST patients had altered regional neural activity and inter-regional connectivity in partial auditory and non-auditory brain regions, mainly involving the default mode network and audio-visual network, which could further improve our understanding of the neuroimaging mechanism in ST.",Academic Journal,diagnostic images,research,tables/charts,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=132699263&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,132699263,126,60,11,", <Blank>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coupled with a forecast of increased hearing loss burden worldwide, national and international health organizations have urgently recommended that access to hearing evaluation be expanded to meet demand. The objective of this study was to develop 'AutoAudio' – a novel deep learning proof-of-concept model that accurately and quickly interprets diagnostic audiograms. Adult audiogram reports representing normal, conductive, mixed and sensorineural morphologies were used to train different neural network architectures. Image augmentation techniques were used to increase the training image set size. Classification accuracy on a separate test set was used to assess model performance. The architecture with the highest out-of-training set accuracy was ResNet-101 at 97.5%. Neural network training time varied between 2 to 7 h depending on the depth of the neural network architecture. Each neural network architecture produced misclassifications that arose from failures of the model to correctly label the audiogram with the appropriate hearing loss type. The most commonly misclassified hearing loss type were mixed losses. Re-engineering the process of hearing testing with a machine learning innovation may help enhance access to the growing worldwide population that is expected to require audiologist services.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, cluster-sample survey of 6581 children (response: 85%; grade 1: n = 3367; grade 5: n = 3214) in 89 schools in Melbourne, Australia, was performed. Slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was defined as a low-frequency pure-tone average across 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz and/or a high-frequency pure-tone average across 3, 4, and 6 kHz of 16 to 40 dB hearing level in the better ear, with air/bone-conduction gaps of < 10 dB. Parents reported children's health-related quality of life and behavior. Each child with slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, matched to 2 normally hearing children (low-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average of < or = 15 dB hearing level in both ears), completed standardized assessments. Whole-sample comparisons were adjusted for type of school, grade level, and gender, and matched-sample comparisons were adjusted for nonverbal IQ scores. RESULTS: Fifty-five children (0.88%) had slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Children with and without sensorineural hearing loss scored similarly in language (mean: 97.2 vs 99.7), reading (101.1 vs 102.8), behavior (8.4 vs 7.0), and parent- and child-reported child health-related quality of life (77.6 vs 80.0 and 76.1 vs 77.0, respectively), but phonologic short-term memory was poorer (91.0 vs 102.8) in the sensorineural hearing loss group.

In this study, we examined changes in brain anatomy associated with tinnitus using anatomical scans from 128 participants with tinnitus and hearing loss, tinnitus with clinically normal hearing, and non-tinnitus controls with clinically normal hearing. The groups were matched for hearing loss, age and gender. We employed voxel- and surface-based morphometry (SBM) to investigate gray and white matter volume and thickness within regions-ofinterest (ROI) that were based on the results of previous studies. The largest overall effects were found for age, gender, and hearing loss. With regard to tinnitus, analysis of ROI revealed numerous small increases and decreases in gray matter and thickness between tinnitus and non-tinnitus controls, in both cortical and subcortical structures. For whole brain analysis, the main tinnitus-related significant clusters were found outside sensory auditory structures. These include a decrease in cortical thickness for the tinnitus group compared to controls in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and a decrease in cortical volume with hearing loss in left Heschl's gyrus (HG). For masked analysis, we found a decrease in gray matter volume in the right Heschle's gyrus for the tinnitus group compared to the controls. We found no changes in the subcallosal region as reported in some previous studies. Overall, while some of the morphological differences observed in this study are similar to previously published findings, others are entirely different or even contradict previous results.

DESIGN: A test of the ability to identify environmental sounds was developed, employing closed sets of ten sounds in each of four different settings (General Home, Kitchen, Office, and Outdoors). The participants in the study included a group of three laboratory-trained subjects with normal hearing and a group of three subjects with profound deafness who were experienced users of a tactual device (the Tactaid 7). Identification testing was conducted in each of the four environmental-sound settings using a one-interval, ten-alternative, forced-choice procedure. The laboratory-trained subjects received training with trial-by-trial correct-answer feedback, followed by testing in the absence of feedback using the Tactaid 7 device. The experienced tactual-aid users were tested initially without feedback to establish baseline levels of performance derived from their prior field experience with the Tactaid 7. These subjects then received additional trials in the presence of correct-answer feedback to determine the effects of training on their performance. The data were summarized in terms of overall percent-correct identification scores and information transfer (IT) in bits. Confusion patterns were described using a hierarchical clustering analysis. RESULTS: Post-training results with the laboratory-trained subjects on the Tactaid 7 indicated that performance was similar for the four test environments, with percent-correct scores averaging 65% (and IT of 2.0 bits). For the experienced tactual-aid users, performance was similar across the four environments, averaging 36% correct (and IT of 1.4 bits) for initial testing without feedback. Scores were increased to 60% correct (and IT of 1.9 bits) in the presence of correct-answer feedback. Similar trends were observed in the hierarchical-clustering analysis across both groups of subjects. Within each stimulus set, certain items tended to cluster together, whereas other items tended to appear in single-item clusters. The highly identified stimuli tended to be characterized by unique temporal patterns and confused stimuli seemed to be most similar in terms of their spectral characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Through the multi-channel spectral display of the Tactaid 7 device, subjects were able to identify roughly 2 bits of information in each of four 10-item sets of sounds representative of different environmental settings. Temporal cues appeared to play a larger role in identification of sounds than spectral or intensive cues.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=106738009&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,106738009,131,24,6,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM14663352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the levels of expression of CLR mRNAs in normal skin and in cholesteatoma. Methods: Cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 38 patients with acquired cholesteatoma. The levels of expression of various CLR mRNAs were assessed quantitatively using real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and correlated with age, sex, the presence of bacteria, hearing level, frequency of surgery, and degree of ossicle destruction. Results: The levels of CD206 (cluster of differentiation 206), DEC-205 (Dendritic and epithelial cell-205), MGL (monoacylglycerol lipase), CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5 member A), Dectin-2 (dendrite cell-associated C-type lectin-2), BDCA2 (Blood dendritic cell antigen 2), Mincle, DCIR (dendritic cell immunoreceptor), Dectin-1, MICL (Myeloid inhibitory C type-like lectin), and CLEC12B (C-type lectin domain family 12, member B) mRNAs were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p < 0.05).

We assumed that application of real time fMRI neurofeedback helps to reduce stress and negative feelings caused by tinnitus. Haller et al. made the first attempts to treat tinnitus with rt-fMRI-neurofeedback in 2010. Based on the results of studies showing that disruption of the auditory cortex with TMS promotes noise reduction (Kleinjung et al. 2005) Haller et al. conducted an experiment on which people suffering from tinnitus have undergone therapy aimed at reducing the activity of the auditory cortex. Surveys (TFIs) carried out 2 weeks after training showed improvement in 2 out of 6 subjects. More recent studies on the effectiveness of auditory cortex deactivation training in tinnitus therapy conducted in two experimental groups including continuous and intermittent neurofeedback showed greater effectiveness (at trend level) of continuous training measured using the TFI scale immediately after training and 6 weeks later (Emmert et al. 2017). The above results indicate the limited effectiveness of tinnitus therapy by reducing the activity of the auditory cortex with rtfMRI- neurofeedback therapy. This is probably due to both the undetermined etiology of this disease and the early developmental stage of the therapy used. Recent reviews indicate the efficacy of rt-fMRI-neurofeedback in changing brain activity in targeted areas in approximately 60% of studies (Alkoby et al. 2018; Thibault et al. 2018) while behavioral changes are observed in about 40% of studies (Thibault et al. 2018), and clinical improvement of patients in 20--30% (Thibault et al. 2018). The relatively high effectiveness of modulation of brain activity using rt-fMRI-neurofeedback gives the possibility of a causal study of neuronal mechanisms in both a healthy brain and pathological conditions, and the study of the impact of the activity of various structures on improving the functioning of patients (e.g. amygdala in tinnitus [Davies'a et al. 2017]). Mechanisms of rt-fMRI-neurofeedback are particularly interesting from both a cognitive and clinical point of view. Understanding these mechanisms would make it possible to consciously modulate the activity of brain structures and their impact on the causes and symptoms of studied disorders. To this aim, by using the new possibilities resulting from the continuous development of new rt-fMRI-neurofeedback methods (training individualization, process training sessions, the use of machine learning methods) and the availability of open software (openNFT, opendecnef), we have undertaken research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of neurofeedback and the possibilities transfer of brain autoregulation skills between modalities of stimuli and feedback signals used.

This study aims to assess the performance of several self-reported hearing measures to identify hearing loss in a group of Iowa farmers. METHODS: The study subjects were 98 male farmers who participated in the Iowa Farm Family Health and Hazard Survey. We tested three self-reported hearing measures; the hearing screening questions, the Rating Scale for Each Ear (RSEE), and the Health, Education and Welfare-Expanded Hearing Ability Scale (HEW-EHAS), which were originally developed and implemented in the National Health Interview Survey. The sensitivity and specificity of the self-reported hearing measures were assessed by comparing them with pure tone threshold averages. These sensitivity and specificity measures were compared between younger and older age groups. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the screening questions, RSEE, and HEW-EHAS were 73.0%, 66.7%, and 53.3%, respectively. The specificities of the self-reported hearing measures were similar, which ranged from 81.4% to 84.8%. The sensitivities of the self-reported hearing measures were higher in the younger age group while the specificities were higher in the older age group.

DESIGN: Better-ear threshold distributions (selected percentiles and their confidence intervals) were estimated using linear interpolation. The 95% confidence intervals for the medians for the two surveys were compared graphically for each of the four age groups and for both men and women. In addition, we calculated odds ratios comparing the prevalences of better-ear hearing impairment (thresholds > 25 dB HL) between the two surveys, for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, and for their four-frequency average. RESULTS: Across age and sex groups, median thresholds were lower (better) in the 1999-2004 survey at 500, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz (8000 Hz was not tested in the 1959-1962 survey). For both men and women, the prevalence of hearing impairment was significantly lower in 1999-2004 at 500, 2000, and 4000 Hz, but not at 1000 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: For men and women of a specific age, high-frequency hearing thresholds were lower (better) in 1999-2004 than in 1959-1962. The prevalences of hearing impairment were also lower in the recent survey. Differences seen at 500 Hz may be attributable at least in part to changes in standards for ambient noise in audiometry.

METHODS: We analyzed a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial, with schools as the unit of randomization. Thirty-four rural schools were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. The intervention included classroom instruction, distribution of hearing protection devices, direct mailings, noise level assessments, and yearly audiometric testing. The control group received the audiometric testing. RESULTS: Students exposed to the hearing conservation program reported more frequent use of hearing protection devices, but there was no evidence of reduced levels of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that, since NIHL is cumulative, a 3-year study was likely not long enough to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention. While improvements in reported use of hearing protection devices were noted, the lasting impact of these behaviors is unknown and the finding merits corroboration by longer term objective hearing tests.

The purposes of the study were (1) to test the sensitivity of the neural network to speaker variation typically in adult speaker groups, (2) to evaluate two normalization procedures to overcome the effects of speaker variation, and (3) to compare tone recognition performance of the neural network with that of the human listeners.Design: A feedforward multilayer neural network was used. Twenty-nine adult native Mandarin Chinese speakers were recruited to record tone samples. The F0 contours of the vowel part of the 1044 monosyllabic words recorded were extracted using an autocorrelation method. Samples from the F0 contours were used as inputs to the neural network. The efficacy of the neural network was first tested by varying the number of inputs and the number of neurons in the hidden layer from 1 to 16. The sensitivity of the neural network to speaker variation was tested by (1) using the raw F0 data from speech tokens of a number of randomly drawn speakers that varied from 1 to 29, (2) using the raw F0 data from speech tokens of either male-only or female-only speakers, and (3) using two sets of normalized F0 data (i.e., tone 1-based normalization and first-order derivative) from speech tokens from a number of randomly drawn speakers that varied from 1 to 29. The recognition performance of the neural network under several experimental conditions was compared with the corresponding recognition performance of 10 normal-hearing, native Mandarin Chinese speaking adult listeners.Results: Three inputs and four hidden neurons were found to be sufficient for the neural network to perform at about 85% correct using speech samples without normalization. The performance of the neural network was affected by variation across speakers particularly between genders. Using the tone 1-based normalization procedure, the performance of the neural network improved significantly. The recognition accuracy of the neural network as a whole or for each tone was comparable with that of the human listeners.Conclusions: The neural network can be used to evaluate the tone production of Mandarin Chinese speaking adults with human listener-like recognition accuracy. The tone 1-based normalization procedure improves the performance of the neural network to human listener-like accuracy. The success of our neural network in recognizing tones from multiple speakers supports its utility for evaluating tone production. Further testing of the neural network with hearing-impaired speakers might reveal its potential use for clinical evaluation of tone production.",Academic Journal,equations & formulas,pictorial,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=105966057&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,105966057,140,29,3,"Baltimore, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM18453884,,,,,,,,,,,,,tables/charts,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of 36 tests and subtests administered to entering first graders were well described by a 4-factor solution. These factors and the tests that loaded most heavily on them were reading-related skills (phonological awareness, letter and word identification); visual cognition (visual perceptual abilities, spatial perception, visual memory); verbal cognition (language development, vocabulary, verbal concepts); and speech processing (the ability to understand speech under difficult listening conditions). A cluster analysis identified 9 groups of children, each with a different profile of scores on the 4 factors. Within these groups, the proportion of students with unsatisfactory reading achievement in the first 2 years of elementary school (as reflected in teacher-assigned grades) varied from 3% to 40%. The profiles of factor scores demonstrated the primary influence of the reading-related skills factor on reading achievement and also on other areas of academic performance. The second strongest predictor of reading and mathematics grades was the visual cognition factor, followed by the verbal cognition factor. The speech processing factor was the weakest predictor of academic achievement, accounting for less than 1% of the variance in reading achievement.

Young children underwent auditory screening; those with persistent (4 to 6 mo) bilateral OME were recruited.Results: The mean duration of effusion over 1-yr follow-up was 142 days (36%) in the ventilation tube (VT) group versus 277 days (70%) in the watchful waiting (WW) group. After 6 mo of follow-up, the pure-tone average in the VT group was 5.6 dB A better than that in the WW group. After 12 mo, most of the advantage in the VT group had disappeared. After the insertion of ventilation tubes, the children with poorer hearing levels at randomization improved more than the children with better hearing levels. The largest difference in hearing levels was found between the children in the VT group whose ventilation tubes remained in situ and the children in the WW group. In the VT children with recurrence of OME, the hearing levels again increased, but remained slightly lower than those in the infants with persistent OME in the WW group.Conclusions: Ventilation tubes have a beneficial effect on hearing in the short run (6 mo); this effect, however, largely disappears in the long run (12 mo).

Methods: In this study, 10718 cases were selected by random cluster sampling from rural and urban population in Ardabil province. Data was gathered using screening questionnaire, normal- and impaired-hearing individual questionnaire, and clinical audiometry. Statistical indices were calculated and data was analyzed using chi-square test. Results: 7.1 per thousand individuals suffer hearing impairment and 4.3 per thousand are deaf. Hearing impairment was significantly more among villagers and aged individuals (p=0.46). However, there was no significant deference between two genders (p>0.05). Our results also showed significant deference in consanguineous marriage (p=0.031), accidents in pregnancy (p=0.007), older age of mother (p=0.007), parents hearing loss, severe illness during childhood (p=0.001), low family income (p=0.004), rural housing and educational level of parents (p=0.001) with hearing impairment.

Several studies have demonstrated that, in fact, performance of a test battery can be inferior to the best of the tests it includes. These studies have been quite persuasive in damping enthusiasm for the test battery approach. Because the results of all tests in a battery were weighted equally in these studies, it is not surprising that an individual test with good sensitivity and specificity is more effective diagnostically than a combination of tests with poorer sensitivity and specificity. The authors of many of these studies were well aware of the limitations of this approach. In the present study, neural networks were applied to evaluate audiological tests used to predict retrocochlear pathology by differentially weighting the results of the tests in the battery. This technique avoids some of the limitations of previous approaches. Of the audiological tests evaluated in the present analysis, the superiority of the auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) in predicting retrocochlear disease was again demonstrated. However, the results also demonstrated that identification accuracy could be improved by combining the ABR with other tests (in this case contralateral acoustic reflex at 2000 Hz, ipsilateral acoustic reflex at 2000 Hz, tone decay, and word recognition score). Further, it was demonstrated that performance could be improved over that obtained using dichotomous test measures (i.e., positive or negative presence of pathology) by using raw test measures in conjunction with ABR.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=107211681&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,107211681,145,42,2,"Rockville, Maryland",,,,,,,pmid,NLM10229447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite that, HA use is suboptimal, and communication issues and hearing-related activity limitations and participation restrictions often remain. Web-based self-management communication programs may support people with hearing loss to effectively self-manage the impact of hearing loss in their daily lives.Objective: The goal of the research is to examine the short- and long-term effects of a web-based self-management SUpport PRogram (SUPR) on communication strategy use (primary outcome) and a range of secondary outcomes for HA users aged 50 years and older.Methods: Clients of 36 HA dispensing practices were randomized to SUPR (SUPR recipients; n=180 HA users) and 34 to care as usual (controls; n=163 HA users). SUPR recipients received a practical support booklet and online materials delivered via email over the course of their 6-month HA rehabilitation trajectory. They were encouraged to appoint a communication partner and were offered optional email contact with the HA dispensing practice. The online materials included 3 instruction videos on HA handling, 5 videos on communication strategies, and 3 testimonial videos. Care as usual included a HA fitting rehabilitation trajectory only. Measurements were carried out at baseline, immediately postintervention, 6 months postintervention, and 12 months postintervention. The primary outcome measure was self-reported use of communication strategies (3 subscales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired [CPHI]). Secondary outcome measures included self-reported personal adjustment to hearing loss (CPHI); use, satisfaction and benefit of HAs and SUPR (use questionnaire; International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids [IOI-HA], Alternative Interventions [IOI-AI]); recommendation of HA dispensing services; self-efficacy for HA handling (Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids [MARS-HA]); readiness to act on hearing loss (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment adapted for hearing loss [URICA-HL]); and hearing disability (Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap [AIADH]).Results: Linear mixed model analyses (intention to treat) showed no significant differences between the SUPR and control group in the course of communication strategy use (CPHI). Immediately postintervention, SUPR recipients showed significantly higher self-efficacy for advanced HA handling than the controls, which was sustained at 12 months (MARS-HA; mean difference immediately postintervention: 5.3, 95% CI 0.3 to 10.4; P=.04). Also, SUPR recipients showed significantly greater HA satisfaction than controls immediately postintervention (IOI-HA; 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.5; P=.006), which was sustained at 12 months, and significantly greater HA use than the controls immediately postintervention (IOI-HA; 0.3, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.5; P=.03), which was not sustained at 12 months.Conclusions: This study provides ground to recommend adding SUPR to standard HA dispensing care, as long-term, modest improvements in HA outcomes were observed.

Baldi can speak slowly; illustrate articulation by making the skin transparent to reveal the tongue, teeth, and palate; and show supplementary articulatory features, such as vibration of the neck to show voicing and turbulent airflow to show frication. Seven students with hearing loss between the ages of 8 and 13 were trained for 6 hours across 21 weeks on 8 categories of segments (4 voiced vs. voiceless distinctions, 3 consonant cluster distinctions, and 1 fricative vs. affricate distinction).

Descriptive statistics and cluster analysis were used to examine their responses.Results: The majority of caregivers were unsure how cCMV was spread, the symptoms of cCMV, and why cCMV screening of infants was important. Most caregivers did not know that cCMV screening was required by law in Utah if an infant is referred after newborn hearing screening. A majority wanted to know if their child had cCMV even if asymptomatic and were willing to pay $20 for cCMV screening. Caregivers of children who had been tested for cCMV were significantly more likely to be strongly in favor of cCMV screening than expected by chance. Caregivers in the highly knowledgeable cluster were more likely to be strongly in favor of cCMV screening.Conclusions: Caregivers frequently were unaware of cCMV and its implications.

One hundred and fifty-one patients (67 males and 84 females) with Meniere's disease were treated in the Neuro-otological clinic, Kitasato University Hospital from 1990 to 1995. Ages ranged from 17 to 77 years (mean 47.3 years) at the onset of the disease when the first vertigo attack occurred. There were 106 (70.1%) in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and 28 (18.5%) aged 60 years or over. Seventy-eight patients visited the clinic within one year of the onset of the disease, but the mean interval was 4 years and 5 months (the longest was 25 years). The mean duration time for the follow-up studies from the time of their first visit to the hospital was 2 years and 5 months. The bilateral ears were invaded in 19 patients (12.6%) and the mean length of their time course was 9 years and 10 months which is longer than the length in unilateral cases. Several important key points for diagnosis of Meniere's disease were investigated in 28 of the 151 cases who had been followed up successfully over a relatively long time course (the mean follow-up time was 7 years and 3 months). Fluctuated or stational cochlear signs, such as tinnitus, hearing impairment and/or fullness in the ear, had started prior to the onset of the first vertigo attack in 17 (61%) of 28 cases. Vertigo without cochlear sign appearing at the onset and cochlear signs were combined later in six (21%) of the 28 cases. Only five (18%) of the 28 cases had vertigo combined with a cochlear sign simultaneously at the onset of the disease. The affected ear was on the left in 15 cases and on the right in seven of 22 unilateral cases. In six bilateral cases the left ear was the first to be invaded in four out of six cases. The interval between the first and second attacks was over 1 year in six of the 28 cases and over 6 months in 10 of the 28 cases. Nine out of the 28 patients had recurrence of vertigo attacks during the first month and five of the nine had a cluster of attacks in the first month. Our study of 28 patients over a long time course revealed eight patients (28.6%) free from the disease. These patients had no recurrence of vertigo for more than 2 years after their last attack, and sixteen (57.1%) of the 28 patients had no recurrence of vertigo for more than 1 year. However, a long period of relief time of more than 2 years in 11 of the 28 patients and a period of more than 1 year was noticed in 16 of the 28 patients. Hearing levels at the middle and low frequencies in the first hearing test were compared with the last test. The mean of hearing levels changed from 38.1 to 36.2 dB after 2 years and 1 month in six cases with the right ear affected and from 34.1 to 45.3 dB after 5 years and 3 months in 15 cases with the left ear affected, but in seven cases with bilateral diseased ears the hearing in both ears became worse, from 25.5 to 57.1 dB in the right ear and from 30.5 to 53.6 dB in the left ear during a period of more than 10 years. These clinical findings should be utilized for diagnosis at the onset of Meniere's disease to determine the interval for observation in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment.",Academic Journal,research,tables/charts,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=107311605&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,107311605,155,116,2,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, preoperative functional status of the cerebral cortex has only been investigated in small numbers of patients. Hence, the current study was performed to reveal functional neuroimaging signatures of speech outcome after CI in prelingually deaf patients using resting-state FDG-PET big-data based machine learning approach and to suggest a outcome prediction model based on cortical predictors of CI outcome. A total of 111 prelingually deaf children underwent pre-CI resting-state FDG-PET. This FDG-PET was used to predict post-CI 3 year speech outcome with regard to open set word and sentence test under auditory-only (A- only) and audiovisual (AV) conditions. FDG-PET data was preprocessed with MarsBaR toolbox for region of interest (ROI) analysis, and 90 cerebral cortical ROIs were used for the analysis. For statistical analysis, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression analysis using average glucose metabolism of 90 ROIs with regard to post-CI 3 year open set word and sentence scores. In prelingually deaf CI users, activations of the suprerior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus were predictors of higher post-CI 3 year speech outcome under the A-only condition. Meanwhile, under A-V condition, an additional activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus was necessary to show better speech outcome. In prelingually deaf CI users, activations of the ventral attention network and prefrontal top-down modulator are important to better process language under the A-only condition. Under A-V condition, an additional activation of the salience network is necessary to better understand multimodal information. Taken together, FDGPET- based machine learning using LASSO could predict CI outcome in prelingually deaf subjects, functional neuroimaging- based outcome prediction may be of help for precision medicine in CI subjects.",Academic Journal,abstract,proceedings,research,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=131274875&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,131274875,157,8,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, scientists have developed support vector machine learning (SVML) techniques that can learn to recognize patterns by classifying seen data. By using SVML, based on the known properties learned from the trained data, these algorithms may predict the presence or absence of tinnitus. We therefore combined resting- state quantitative electroencephalography (rs-qEEG) with SVML to develop a brain-based electrophysiological signature for the presence of tinnitus. One hundred and twenty-nine tinnitus patients and 233 healthy controls underwent rs-qEEG measurements for 5 minutes. Using these data as training sets, feature extraction was performed both by principal component analysis (PCA) and by NMF, and a classification model was developed by the linear-kernel SVML with 10-fold cross-validation. The accuracy of classification and the area under curve (AUC) were calculated for each method. As compared with PCA-SVM approach (accuracy 0.85, AUC 0.94), NMF-SVM approach yielded better classification performance (accuracy 0.92, AUC 0.96). When compared to upper-10% baseline activity of the control group, that of the tinnitus group showed relatively higher activity at the left auditory cortex, inferior frontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampus. The classifier developed in the current study distinguished tinnitus or no-tinnitus with high fidelity. Also, the main areas that classified tinnitus or no-.innitus replicated previously reported areas that are involved in the generation of tinnitus or tinnitus-related distress. NMF-SVM-based diagnosis of the presence of tinnitus has yielded an accuracy of 92%. Also, relatively increased baseline activities in the tinnitus group as compared with the control group in areas that were repeatedly found in previous tinnitus research may reconfirm the validity of the current approach. Future study using bigger database may raise the classification accuracy and eventually enable us to develop an objective diagnostic tool of tinnitus.",Academic Journal,abstract,research,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=127380354&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,127380354,159,7,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Short exposure to H2O2 (1 h, 0.1 mM) induced premature cellular senescence in House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 auditory cells. The transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that damaged mitochondria and autophagosomes containing dense organelles appeared in the auditory cells after short exposure to H2O2. The branch and junction parameters of the skeletonized image of the mitochondria were found to decrease significantly in H2O2-treated cells. A branched reticulum of tubules was poorly formed, featuring coexistence of numerous tiny clusters along with few relatively large entities in the H2O2-treated cells. In terms of bioenergetics, H2O2-treatment led to the dose-dependent decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in the auditory cells. The fragmented mitochondria (fusion < fission) were in a low potential. In addition, the potential of hyperfused mitochondria (fusion > fission) was slightly lower than the control cells. The short-time exposure of live auditory cells to H2O2 damaged the mitochondrial respiratory capacity without any effect on the baseline ATP production rates. The vulnerability of the mitochondrial membrane potential to the uncoupling reagent was increased after H2O2 treatment. Our findings indicated that the mitochondrial dysfunction due to the decline in the O2 consumption rate should be the first event of premature senescence process in the auditory cells, resulting in the imbalance of mitochondrial fusion/fission and the collapse of the mitochondrial network. Auditory system senescence: Mitochondrial dynamics and respiration The mitochondrial morphology and physiology could influence the process of age-related hearing loss. Prof. Tatsuya Yamasoba's research group at the University of Tokyo has examined the functional changes of mitochondria in terms of its respiratory function, membrane potential and morphology under premature senescence induced by oxidative stress in an auditory cell line. The morphological and functional mitochondrial damage were observed as the respiratory capacity deficiency and the fluctuation of the fusion/fission balance. Their results provide evidence of the fundamental interdependence between mitochondrial metabolic activity and its network structure in premature senescence process of auditory cells. This is a pioneer study to indicate the influence of mitochondrial dynamics and respiratory system on the premature senescence process of auditory cells.

Various electrodes from different manufacturers exist and often the patients choose the manufacturer in advance. The surgeons decide, based on their subjective experience, which electrode type and length to implant. It is known that the cochlea anatomy varies in length and shape among the population. There is a large range in the hearing outcomes for CI patients that is not yet sufficiently well understood and we don't have a theoretical model for the optimal electrode position. Methods: Therefore, we suggest a data driven approach: In an ongoing retrospective investigation of more than 670 patients with MED-EL FLEX electrodes, we manually evaluate the pre- and postoperative radiological images in terms of the individual cochlea anatomy (cochlear duct length, lateral wall helix) and the exact post-op location of all inserted electrode contacts. Moreover, speech understanding, residual hearing, medical background and individual history of hearing loss were taken into account. After considerable efforts to normalize, clean, and link all the mentioned information, we can apply and compare different supervised machine learning methods like decision trees, Gaussian processes, neural networks, or logistic regression in order to predict the post-operative speech performance and the residual hearing. For the learning of these models, the different post-op hearing and speech tests have to be combined into a single number to compare the success of implantations. Furthermore, all the pre-operative data have to be mapped to define ""similar"" patients. Conclusion: Now, it is possible to tap the hidden knowledge of a large patient database: Suggesting the optimal electrode and insertion depth that retrospectively led to the best hearing outcome for patients with similar anatomy and residual hearing.

Keine Verbesserung gab es hingegen in einer unrelatierten Kontrollaufgabe (Reime fi nden), was auf die Spezifi tät der erzielten Therapieeffekte schließen lässt.

Yet, relationships between the changes in DPOAE metrics and auditory sensitivity are still poorly understood. Explicating these relationships might support the use of DPOAEs in hearing conservation programs (HCPs) for detecting early damage leading to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) so that mitigating steps might be taken to limit any lasting damage. This report describes the development of DPOAE-based statistical models to assess the risk of hearing loss from cisplatin treatment among cancer patients. Ototoxicity risk assessment (ORA) models were constructed using a machine learning paradigm in which partial least squares and leave-one-out cross-validation were applied, yielding optimal screening algorithms from a set of known risk factors for ototoxicity and DPOAE changes from pre-exposure baseline measures. Single DPOAE metrics alone were poorer indicators of the risk of ototoxic hearing shifts than the best performing multivariate models. This finding suggests that multivariate approaches applied to the use of DPOAEs in a HCP, will improve the ability of DPOAE measures to identify ears with noise-induced mechanical damage and/or hearing loss at each monitoring interval. This prediction must be empirically assessed in noise-exposed subjects.",Academic Journal,Journal Article,,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=104633832&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,104633832,165,51,,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",,,,,,,pmid,NLM22264063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH update to 25 January 2012. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical hearing loss prevention interventions under field conditions among workers exposed to noise. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We included 25 studies. We found no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure but one study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis. Eight studies with 3,430 participants evaluated immediate and long-term effects of personal hearing protection devices (HPDs) and sixteen studies with 82,794 participants evaluated short and long-term effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). The overall quality of studies was low to very low.The one ITS study that evaluated the effect of new legislation in reducing noise exposure found that the median noise level decreased by 27.7 dB(A) (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 dB) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation and that this was associated with a favourable downward trend in time of -2.1 dB per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7).Hearing protection devices attenuated noise with about 20 dB(A) with variation among brands and types but for ear plugs these findings depended almost completely on proper instruction of insertion. Noise attenuation ratings of hearing protection under field conditions were consistently lower than the ratings provided by the manufacturers.One cluster-RCT compared a three-year information campaign as part of a hearing loss prevention programme for agricultural students to audiometry only with three and 16-year follow-up but there were no significant differences in hearing loss. Another study compared a HLPP, which provided regular personal noise exposure information, to a programme without this information in a CBA design. Exposure information was associated with a favourable but non-significant reduction of the rate of hearing loss of -0.82 dB per year (95% CI -1.86 to 0.22). Another cluster-RCT evaluated the effect of extensive on-site training sessions and the use of personal noise-level indicators versus information only on noise levels but did not find a significant difference after four months follow-up (Mean Difference (MD) -0.30 dB(A) (95%CI -3.95 to 3.35).There was very low quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of HPDs as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs. Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect.In four long-term studies, workers in a HLPP still had a 0.5 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than workers that were not exposed to noise (95% CI -0.5 to 1.7) which is about the level of hearing loss caused by exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, two other studies showed substantial risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers. There is low quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Even though case studies show that substantial reductions in noise levels in the workplace can be achieved, there are no controlled studies of the effectiveness of such measures. The effectiveness of hearing protection devices depends on training and their proper use. There is very low quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. Better implementation and reinforcement of HLPPs is needed. Better evaluations of technical interventions and long-term effects are needed.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]",Database,research,systematic review,Journal Article,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=105380840&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,105380840,167,,10,", <Blank>",,,,,,,pmid,NLM23076923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These records consist of audiograms (graphs of the faintest sounds audible to the patient at six different pitches), categorical data (such as age, gender, diagnosis and hearing aid type) and brief free text notes made by the technicians. This data is mined to determine which factors contribute to the decision to fit a BTE (worn behind the ear) hearing aid as opposed to an ITE (worn in the ear) hearing aid.Methods: From PCA (principal component analysis) four main audiogram types are determined, and are related to the type of hearing aid chosen. The effects of age, gender, diagnosis, masker, mould and individual audiogram frequencies are combined into a single model by means of logistic regression. Some significant keywords are also discovered in the free text fields by using the chi-squared (χ(2)) test, which can also be used in the model. The final model can act a decision support tool to help decide whether an individual patient should be offered a BTE or an ITE hearing aid.Results: The final model was tested using 5-fold cross validation, and was able to replicate the decisions of audiologists whether to fit an ITE or a BTE hearing aid with precision in the range 0.79 to 0.87.Conclusions: A decision support system was produced to predict the type of hearing aid which should be prescribed, with an explanation facility explaining how that decision was arrived at. This system should prove useful in providing a ""second opinion"" for audiologists.",Academic Journal,research,Journal Article,,English,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,shib&db=jlh&AN=104359968&site=ehost-live&scope=site&custid=s8454451",jlh,CINAHL Plus,104359968,168,12,Suppl 1,,age,Middle Aged: 45-64 years,gender,Female,gender,Male,pmid,NLM22595091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
