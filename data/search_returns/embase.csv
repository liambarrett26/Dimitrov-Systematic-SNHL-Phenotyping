For people suffering from hearing loss, mobile applications might be designed to support the decision-making processes in auditory diagnostics and to provide treatment recommendations to the user (e.g., hearing aid need). For some individuals, such mobile app might be the first contact with a hearing diagnostic service and should motivate users with hearing loss to seek professional help. Objective(s): This study aims at characterizing individuals who are more or less prone to seek professional help after the repeated use of an app-based hearing test. The goal is to develop a profiling module building upon hearing related traits and personality characteristics to secure personalized treatment recommendations in hearing mHealth solutions. Method(s): N=185 (106 females) non-aided older individuals (Mage=63.8, SDage=6.6) with subjective hearing loss participated in a comprehensive online study. We collected cross-sectional and longitudinal data on several hearing-related and psychological features that were previously found to predict hearing help-seeking. Readiness to seek help was assessed as outcome variable at study-end and after two months. Participants were classified into help-seekers and non-seekers with several supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine). The most relevant features for prediction were identified with feature importance analysis. Result(s): The algorithms correctly predicted action to seek help at study-end in 66 to 70% of cases, reaching 75% classification accuracy at follow-up. Among the most important features for classifications were the degree of hearing loss and its perceived consequences in daily life, attitude towards hearing aids, and the personality traits neuroticism and conscientiousness. Conclusion(s): This study contributes to the identification of individual characteristics that predict help-seeking in older individuals with self-perceived hearing loss. Suggestions for the implementation of an individual profiling algorithm and for targeted recommendations in hearing mHealth applications are derived.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A prevailing view is that such ribbon loss (known as synaptopathy) selectively impacts those low-spontaneous-rate and high-threshold ANFs contacting predominantly the modiolar face of IHCs. However, the spatial pattern of synaptopathy remains scarce in the most sensitive mid-cochlear region, where long and short IHCs with distinct ribbon size gradients coexist. Here, we used volume electron microscopy to investigate noise exposure-related changes in the mouse IHCs with and without ribbon loss. Our quantifications reveal that the worst-hit areas of synaptopathy are the modiolar face of long IHCs and the pillar face of short IHCs. Moreover, we show relative enrichment of mitochondrial content in the survived ANF terminals, providing key experimental evidence for the long-proposed role of postsynaptic mitochondria in selective ribbon synapse degeneration following noise insult.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Despite evidence from our lab and others about its polygenic nature, little is known about the specific genes, cell types and pathways involved in ARHL, impeding the development of therapeutic interventions. In this manuscript, we describe, for the first time, the complete cell-type specific transcriptome of the aging mouse cochlea using snRNA-seq in an outbred mouse model in relation to auditory threshold variation. Cochlear cell types were identified using unsupervised clustering and annotated via a three-tiered approach - first by linking to expression of known marker genes, then using the NS-Forest algorithm to select minimum cluster-specific marker genes and reduce dimensional feature space for statistical comparison of our clusters with existing publicly-available data sets on the gEAR website (https://umgear.org/), and finally, by validating and refining the annotations using Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) and the cluster-specific marker genes as probes. We report on 60 unique cell-types expanding the number of defined cochlear cell types by more than two times. Importantly, we show significant specific cell type increases and decreases associated with loss of hearing acuity implicating specific subsets of hair cell subtypes, ganglion cell subtypes, and cell subtypes withing the stria vascularis in this model of ARHL.

There is a need for accurate, contemporary national data on the prevalence, risk factors and impacts of vision and hearing loss in Australian adults. Objective(s): The Australian Eye and Ear Health Survey (AEEHS) aims to determine the prevalence, risk factors and impacts of vision and hearing loss in both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous older adults. Methods and analysis: The AEEHS is a population-based cross-sectional survey which will include 5,000 participants (3250 non-Indigenous aged 50 years or older and 1750 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 40 years or older) from 30 sites covering urban and rural/regional geographic areas, selected using a multi-stage, random cluster sampling strategy. Questionnaires will be administered to collect data on socio-demographic, medical, ocular and otological history. The testing battery includes assessment of blood pressure, blood sugar, anthropometry, visual acuity (presenting, unaided, pinhole and best-corrected), refraction, tonometry, slit lamp and dilated eye examination, ocular imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT-angiography and retinal photography, and automated visual fields. Audiometry, tympanometry and video otoscopy will also be performed. The primary outcomes are age-standardised prevalence of cause-specific vision and hearing impairment. Secondary outcomes are prevalence of non-blinding eye diseases (including dry eye disease), patterns in health service utilisation, universal health coverage metrics, risk factors for vision and hearing impairment, and impact on quality of life. Ethics: The protocol for this study was approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC-2020/818) and Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Research Ethics Committee (HREC-EO303-20211008). Dissemination of results: Our findings will be disseminated through presentation at meetings and peer-reviewed publications. Findings will also be widely disseminated by project partners with the aim of improving public health policy directives and equitable service delivery to prevent avoidable vision and hearing impairment in Australia.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To better understand the auditory processing deficits that underlie this problem, we made large-scale brain recordings from gerbils, a common animal model for human hearing, while presenting a large database of speech and noise sounds. We first used manifold learning to identify the neural subspace in which speech is encoded and found that it is low-dimensional and that the dynamics within it are profoundly distorted by hearing loss. We then trained a deep neural network (DNN) to replicate the neural coding of speech with and without hearing loss and analyzed the underlying network dynamics. We found that hearing loss primarily impacts spectral processing, creating nonlinear distortions in cross-frequency interactions that result in a hypersensitivity to background noise that persists even after amplification with a hearing aid. Our results identify a new focus for efforts to design improved hearing aids and demonstrate the power of DNNs as a tool for the study of central brain structures.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Conventional methods using non-neural measures do not permit accurate prediction on the individual child level. In this study, we investigate whether white matter patterns detected by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predict speech perception improvement. Pre-surgical DTI of CI candidates was compared to matched normal-hearing (NH) children to determine cortical regions affected by hearing impairment. Speech Recognition Index in Quiet was measured at baseline and 6 months post implantation to compute improvement in speech perception. Machine learning prediction of speech perception improvement (high or low) was performed using non-imaging and DTI white matter characteristics of whole, affected and unaffected brain. Affected and unaffected white matter regions were determined by comparing DTI multi-voxel pattern similarity maps of white matter integrity indices between CI and NH. Abnormal white matter patterns were found throughout brain of CI candidates. Prediction of 6-month post-CI improvement accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using unaffected regions (0.86, 0.91, 0.80, respectively) and whole brain white matter (0.85, 0.91, 0.80, respectively) yielded similar results, and were more predictive than regions affected by hearing impairment (0.72, 0.74, 0.70, respectively) or non-imaging features (0.67, 0.55, 0.78, respectively). Findings support that presurgical neural white matter pathways, especially in the association auditory and cognitive regions not affected by auditory deprivation, play a critical role in speech development after CI and are more predictive of outcome than traditional non-neural variables such as age at implant.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

FFRs during high cortical arousal states also have a stronger relationship with speech perception. Aging is associated with increased auditory brain responses, which might reflect degraded inhibitory processing within the peripheral and ascending pathways, or changes in attentional control regulation via descending auditory pathways. Here, we tested the hypothesis that online corticofugal interplay is impacted by age-related hearing loss. We measured EEG in older adults with normal-hearing (NH) and mild to moderate hearing-loss (HL) while they performed speech identification tasks in different noise backgrounds. We measured alpha power to index online cortical arousal states during task engagement. Subsequently, we split brainstem speech-FFRs, on a trial-by-trial basis, according to fluctuations in concomitant cortical alpha power into low or high alpha FFRs to index cortical-brainstem modulation. We found cortical alpha power was smaller in the HL than NH group. In NH listeners, alpha-FFRs modulation for clear speech (i.e., without noise) also resembled that previously observed in younger adults for speech in noise. Cortical-brainstem modulation was further diminished in HL older adults in the clear condition and by noise in NH older adults. Machine learning classification showed low alpha FFR frequency spectra yielded higher accuracy for classifying listeners' perceptual performance in both NH and HL participants. Moreover, low alpha FFRs decreased with increased hearing thresholds at 0.5-2 kHz for clear speech but noise generally reduced low alpha FFRs in the HL group. Collectively, our study reveals cortical arousal state actively shapes brainstem speech representations and provides a potential new mechanism for older listeners' difficulties perceiving speech in cocktail party-like listening situations in the form of a miss-coordination between cortical and subcortical levels of auditory processing.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

One row of IHCs and three rows of OHCs are arranged tonotopically; cells at a particular location respond best to a specific frequency which decreases from base to apex of the cochlea. Loss of hair cells at a specific place affects hearing performance at the corresponding tonotopic frequency. To better understand the underlying cause of hearing loss in patients (or experimental animals) a plot of hair cell survival along the cochlear frequency map, known as a cochleogram, can be generated post-mortem, involving manually counting thousands of cells. Currently, there are no widely applicable tools for fast, unsupervised, unbiased, and comprehensive image analysis of auditory hair cells that work well either with imaging datasets containing an entire cochlea or smaller sampled regions. Current microscopy tools allow for imaging of auditory hair cells along the full length of the cochlea, often yielding more data than feasible to manually analyze. Here, we present a machine learning-based hair cell analysis toolbox for the comprehensive analysis of whole cochleae (or smaller regions of interest). The Hair Cell Analysis Toolbox (HCAT) is a software that automates common image analysis tasks such as counting hair cells, classifying them by subtype (IHCs vs OHCs), determining their best frequency based on their location along the cochlea, and generating cochleograms. These automated tools remove a considerable barrier in cochlear image analysis, allowing for faster, unbiased, and more comprehensive data analysis practices. Furthermore, HCAT can serve as a template for deep-learning-based detection tasks in other types of biological tissue: with some training data, HCAT's core codebase can be trained to develop a custom deep learning detection model for any object on an image.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

While many patients with UHL perform poorly on binaural tasks, some are able to adapt to monaural deficit. We aimed to identify patients with UHL who use compensatory strategies and to explore the neural correlates of this adaptation using Mismatch Negativity (MMN). We recruited 21 patients with UHL and we separated them into three groups using cluster analysis based on measures of binaural processing. The resulting groups were referred to as the better, moderate and poorer performers clusters (BPC, MPC and PPC). We measured the MMN elicited by deviant sounds located 10degree, 20degree or 100degree away from a standard sound. We found that the BPC group had a significant MMN for all three deviant sounds, as in a group of normal-hearing controls. In contrast, the PPC group and normal-hearing controls with an earplug did not have a significant MMN for the 10degree and 20degree deviations. For the 100degree deviation, the scalp distribution was found to be maximal over central regions in the BPC group, while the PPC group showed a more frontal distribution. Differences were also found for the N100 evoked by standard sounds, with the BPC group showing a contralateral pattern of activation, as in the controls, and the PPC group showing more symmetrical hemispheric activation. These results indicate that patients with UHL can develop adaptive strategies that are reflected by sound processing differences at the cortical level.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Fast and efficient diagnostic tools will advance clinical practice by detecting or confirming the condition, tracking change in severity, and monitoring treatment response. Motivated by evidence of subtle anatomical or functional morphological information in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we examined data-driven machine learning methods for joint tinnitus classification (tinnitus or no tinnitus) and tinnitus severity prediction. We propose a deep multi-task multimodal framework for joint functionalities using structural MRI (sMRI) data. To leverage cross-information multimodal neuroimaging data, we integrated two modalities of 3-dimensional sMRI - T1 weighted (T1w) and T2 weighted (T2w) images. To explore the key components in the MR images that drove task performance, we segmented both T1w and T2w images into three different components - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and examined performance of each segmented image. Results demonstrate that our multimodal framework capitalizes on the information across both modalities (T1w and T2w) for the joint task of tinnitus classification and severity prediction. Our model outperforms existing learning-based and conventional methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The latter deficit negatively impacts cochlear implant users' social integration and quality of life; however, emotion perception is not currently part of rehabilitation. Developing rehabilitation programs incorporating emotional cognition requires a deeper understanding of cochlear implant users' residual emotion perception abilities. Method(s): To identify the neural underpinnings of these residual abilities, we investigated whether machine learning techniques could be used to identify emotion-specific patterns of neural activity in cochlear implant users. Using existing electroencephalography data from 22 cochlear implant users, we employed a random forest classifier to establish if we could model and subsequently predict from participants' brain responses the auditory emotions (vocal and musical) presented to them. Result(s): Our findings suggest that consistent emotion-specific biomarkers exist in cochlear implant users, which could be used to develop effective rehabilitation programs incorporating emotion perception training. Conclusion(s): This study highlights the potential of machine learning techniques to improve outcomes for cochlear implant users, particularly in terms of emotion perception.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1186%2fs12883-024-03616-0,SFX,38589815 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38589815]

Method(s): A total of 34 ST patients were selected into electroacupuncture group (EG) and 34 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were recruited into control group (CG). The EG received acupuncture at SI19 (Tinggong), GB11 (Touqiaoyin), TE17 (Yifeng), GV20 (Baihui), GV15 (Yamen), GV14 (Dazhui), SJ13 (Zhongzhu), among which the points of SI19 and GB11 were connected to the electroacupuncture instrument with the density wave of 2/50 Hz, and 3 treatments per week for 10 sessions in total. The severity of tinnitus was evaluated by Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), the hearing status was recorded using pure tone audiometry, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed on the brain before and after treatment, the CG received no intervention yet only rs-fMRI data were collected. Result(s): With the electroacupuncture treatment, the total THI score, average air conduction threshold of patients of EG were significantly lower than before (p < 0.01), and the total effective rate was 88.24%. Compared with CG, FC of ST patients between INS and left superior temporal gyrus and right hippocampal significantly decreased before treatment, while FC of ST patients between INS and right superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and right anterior cuneus significantly decreased after treatment (voxel p < 0.001, cluster p < 0.05, corrected with GRF). FC of ST patients between the INS and right middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus and right paracentral lobule showed a significant decrease after treatment (voxel p < 0.001, cluster p < 0.05, corrected with GRF). In addition, THI score in EG was negatively correlated with the reduction of FC value in INS-left superior frontal gyrus before treatment (r = -0.41, p = 0.017). Therefore, this study suggests that abnormal FC of INS may be one of the significant central mechanisms of ST patients and can be modulated by electroacupuncture. Discussion(s): Electroacupuncture treatment can effectively reduce or eliminate tinnitus symptoms in ST patients and improve the hearing by decreasing FC between the INS and the frontal and temporal brain regions.Copyright © 2024 Zha, Zhang, Shi, Cheng, Rong, Yu, Liu, Xue, Ye, Yang, Qiu and Yang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2024.1373390,SFX,

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of the post-synaptic density (PSD) in the SGN afferent terminals are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) is required for the clustering of AMPA receptors GluR2-4 (glutamate receptors 2-4) at the PSD. Adult Bai1-deficient mice have functional IHCs but fail to transmit information to the SGNs, leading to highly raised hearing thresholds. Despite the almost complete absence of AMPA receptor subunits, the SGN fibers innervating the IHCs do not degenerate. Furthermore, we show that AMPA receptors are still expressed in the cochlea of Bai1-deficient mice, highlighting a role for BAI1 in trafficking or anchoring GluR2-4 to the PSDs. These findings identify molecular and functional mechanisms required for sound encoding at cochlear ribbon synapses.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.celrep.2024.114025,SFX,38564333 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38564333]

(Sebothoma, Khoza-Shangase) Department of Audiology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",Frontiers Media SA,"Introduction: Occupational Noise Induced Hearing Loss (ONIHL) is one of the most prevalent conditions among mine workers globally. This reality is due to mine workers being exposed to noise produced by heavy machinery, rock drilling, blasting, and so on. This condition can be compounded by the fact that mine workers often work in confined workspaces for extended periods of time, where little to no attenuation of noise occurs. The objective of this research work is to present a preliminary study of the development of a hearing loss, early monitoring system for mine workers. Methodology: The system consists of a smart watch and smart hearing muff equipped with sound sensors which collect noise intensity levels and the frequency of exposure. The collected information is transferred to a database where machine learning algorithms namely the logistic regression, support vector machines, decision tree and Random Forest Classifier are used to classify and cluster it into levels of priority. Feedback is then sent from the database to a mine worker smart watch based on priority level. In cases where the priority level is extreme, indicating high levels of noise, the smart watch vibrates to alert the miner. The developed system was tested in a mock mine environment consisting of a 67 metres tunnel located in the basement of a building whose roof top represents the ""surface"" of a mine. The mock-mine shape, size of the tunnel, steel-support infrastructure, and ventilation system are analogous to deep hard-rock mine. The wireless channel propagation of the mock-mine is statistically characterized in 2.4-2.5 GHz frequency band. Actual underground mine material was used to build the mock mine to ensure it mimics a real mine as close as possible. The system was tested by 50 participants both male and female ranging from ages of 18 to 60 years. Results and discussion: Preliminary results of the system show decision tree had the highest accuracy compared to the other algorithms used. It has an average testing accuracy of 91.25% and average training accuracy of 99.79%. The system also showed a good response level in terms of detection of noise input levels of exposure, transmission of the information to the data base and communication of recommendations to the miner. The developed system is still undergoing further refinements and testing prior to being tested in an actual mine.Copyright © 2024 Madahana, Ekoru, Sebothoma and Khoza-Shangase.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2024.1321357,SFX,

Method(s): After a systematic search and quality assessment, 31 records including 383,063 patients were selected (14 epidemiological studies and 17 genetic association studies). General information on the sample size, age, sex, tinnitus prevalence, severe tinnitus distribution, and sensorineural hearing loss was retrieved. Studies that did not include data on hearing assessment were excluded. Relative frequencies were used for qualitative variables to compare different studies and to obtain average values. Genetic variants and genes were listed and clustered according to their potential role in tinnitus development. Result(s): The average prevalence of tinnitus estimated from population-based studies was 26.3% for any tinnitus, and 20% of patients with tinnitus reported it as an annoying symptom. One study has reported population-specific differences in the prevalence of tinnitus, the white ancestry being the population with a higher prevalence. Genome-wide association studies have identified and replicated two common variants in the Chinese population (rs2846071; rs4149577) in the intron of TNFRSF1A, associated with noise-induced tinnitus. Moreover, gene burden analyses in sequencing data from Spanish and Swede patients with severe tinnitus have identified and replicated ANK2, AKAP9, and TSC2 genes. Conclusion(s): The genetic contribution to tinnitus is starting to be revealed and it shows population-specific effects in European and Asian populations. The common allelic variants associated with tinnitus that showed replication are associated with noise-induced tinnitus. Although severe tinnitus has been associated with rare variants with large effect, their role on hearing or hyperacusis has not been established.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1007%2fs10162-024-00925-6,SFX,38334885 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38334885]

Recently developed haptic hearing aids, which convert audio to vibration, can improve speech-in-noise performance for cochlear implant (CI) users and assist those unable to access hearing-assistive devices. They are typically body-worn rather than head-mounted, allowing additional space for batteries and microprocessors, and so can deploy more sophisticated noise-reduction techniques. The current study assessed whether a real-time-feasible dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN) can improve tactile speech-in-noise performance. Audio was converted to vibration on the wrist using a vocoder method, either with or without noise reduction. Performance was tested for speech in a multi-talker noise (recorded at a party) with a 2.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio. An objective assessment showed the DPRNN improved the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio by 8.6 dB and substantially outperformed traditional noise-reduction (log-MMSE). A behavioural assessment in 16 participants showed the DPRNN improved tactile-only sentence identification in noise by 8.2%. This suggests that advanced techniques like the DPRNN could substantially improve outcomes with haptic hearing aids. Low-cost haptic devices could soon be an important supplement to hearing-assistive devices such as CIs or offer an alternative for people who cannot access CI technology.Copyright © 2024.

If such inter-strain heterogeneity is real, it could be exploited to probe molecular pathways mediating neural remodeling in the adult cochlea. Here, we compared synaptopathy repair in CBA/CaJ vs. C57BL/6J, which are at opposite ends of the reported recovery spectrum. We evaluated C57BL/6J mice 0 h, 24 h, 2 wks or 8 wks after exposure for 2 h to octave-band noise (8-16 kHz) at either 90, 94 or 98 dB SPL, to compare with analogous post-exposure results in CBA/CaJ at 98 or 101 dB. We counted pre- and post-synaptic puncta in immunostained cochleas, using machine learning to classify paired (GluA2 and CtBP2) vs. orphan (CtBP2 only) puncta, and batch-processing to quantify immunostaining intensity. At 98 dB, both strains show ongoing loss of ribbons and synapses between 0 and 24 h, followed by partial recovery, however the extent and degree of these changes were greater in C57BL/6J. Much of the synaptic recovery is due to transient reduction in GluA2 intensity in synaptopathic regions. In contrast, CtBP2 intensity showed only transient increases (at 2 wks). Neurofilament staining revealed transient extension of ANF terminals in C57BL/6J, but not in CBA/CaJ, peaking at 24 h and reverting by 2 wks. Thus, although interstrain differences in synapse recovery are dominated by reversible changes in GluA2 receptor levels, the neurite extension seen in C57BL/6J suggests a qualitative difference in regenerative capacity.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2024.108996,SFX,38547565 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38547565]

Background(s): VM is one of the most frequent episodic vertigo characterized by a great clinical variability for duration of attacks and accompanying symptoms. Diagnosis is based only on clinical history of episodic vertigo in 50% of cases associated with migrainous headache or photo/phonophobia. Method(s): We enrolled in different university centers 244 patients affected by definite VM according to the criteria of the Barany Society between January 2022 and December 2022. An audiometric examination and a CNS MRI were performed before inclusion. Patients with low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss were not included, as well as patients with an MRI positive otherwise that for microischemic lesions. Patients were asked to characterize vestibular symptoms choosing among (multiple answers were allowed): internal vertigo, dizziness, visuo-vestibular symptoms/external vertigo; onset of vertigo and duration, neurovegetative, and cochlear accompanying symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, and fullness during attacks) were collected as well as migrainous headache and/or photo/phonophobia during vertigo; autoimmune disorders were also analyzed. A bedside examination was performed including study of spontaneous-positional nystagmus with infrared video goggles, post head shaking ny, skull vibration test, and video head impulse test. Result(s): We included 244 subjects, 181 were females (74.2%). The age of onset of the first vertigo was 36.6 +/- 14.5 while of the first headache was 23.2 +/- 10.1. A positive correlation has been found between the first headache and the first vertigo. The mean duration of vertigo attacks was 11 +/- 16 h. We carried on a cluster analysis to identify subgroups of patients with common clinical features. Four variables allowed to aggregate clusters: age of onset of vertigo, duration of vertigo attacks, presence of migrainous headache during vertigo, and presence of cochlear symptoms during vertigo. We identified 5 clusters: cluster 1/group 1 (23 subjects, 9.4%) characterized by longer duration of vertigo attacks; cluster 2/group 2 (52 subjects, 21.3%) characterized by absence of migrainous headache and cochlear symptoms during vertigo; cluster 3/group 3 (44 subjects, 18%) characterized by presence of cochlear symptoms during vertigo but not headache; cluster 4/group 4 (57 subjects, 23.4%) by the presence of both cochlear symptoms and migrainous headache during vertigo; cluster 5/group 5 (68 subjects, 27.9%) characterized by migrainous headache but no cochlear symptoms during vertigo. Conclusion(s): VM is with any evidence a heterogeneous disorder and clinical presentations exhibit a great variability. In VM, both symptoms orienting toward a peripheral mechanism (cochlear symptoms) and central ones (long lasting positional non-paroxysmal vertigo) may coexist. Our study is the first published trying to characterize subgroups of VM subjects, thus orienting toward different pathophysiological mechanisms.Copyright © Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia 2023.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1007%2fs10072-023-07116-w,SFX,37845481 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37845481]

Method(s): A comprehensive dataset was utilized, encompassing eight-year longitudinal personal hearing threshold levels (HTLs) as well as information on seven personal variables and two environmental variables to establish NIHL predicting models through the ANN technique. Three subdatasets were extracted from the afirementioned comprehensive dataset to assess the advantages of the present study in NIHL predictions. Result(s): The dataset was gathered from 170 workers employed in a steel-making industry, with a median cumulative noise exposure and HTL of 88.40 dBA-year and 19.58 dB, respectively. Utilizing the longitudinal dataset demonstrated superior prediction capabilities compared to cross-sectional datasets. Incorporating the more comprehensive dataset led to improved NIHL predictions, particularly when considering variables such as noise pattern and use of personal protective equipment. Despite fluctuations observed in the measured HTLs, the ANN predicting models consistently revealed a discernible trend. Conclusion(s): A consistent correlation was observed between the measured HTLs and the results obtained from the predicting models. However, it is essential to exercise caution when utilizing the model-predicted NIHLs for individual workers due to inherent personal fluctuations in HTLs. Nonetheless, these ANN models can serve as a valuable reference for the industry in effectively managing its hearing conservation program.Copyright © 2024 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.shaw.2024.02.004,SFX,

Researchers have made efforts to classify relevant audiometric phenotypes, aiming to enhance medical interventions and improve hearing health. We leveraged existing pattern analyses of age-related hearing loss and implemented the phenotype classification via quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). We herein propose a method for analyzing the exposure effects on the soft classification probabilities of the phenotypes via estimating equations. Under reasonable assumptions, the estimating equations are unbiased and lead to consistent estimators. The resulting estimator had good finite sample performances in simulation studies. As an illustrative example, we applied our proposed methods to assess the association between a dietary intake pattern, assessed as adherence scores for the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet calculated using validated food-frequency questionnaires, and audiometric phenotypes (older-normal, metabolic, sensory, and metabolic plus sensory), determined based on data obtained in the Nurses' Health Study II Conservation of Hearing Study, the Audiology Assessment Arm.

Extensive evidence has shown that cholesterol imbalances in the central nervous system occur in aging and in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we characterize cholesterol homeostasis in the inner ear of young and aged mice as a new unexplored possibility for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. Our results show that cholesterol levels in the inner ear are reduced during aging, an effect that is associated with an increased expression of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), the main enzyme responsible for cholesterol turnover in the brain. In addition, we show that pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 with the antiretroviral drug efavirenz reduces the cholesterol content in outer hair cells (OHCs), leading to a decrease in prestin immunolabeling and resulting in an increase in the distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) thresholds. Moreover, dietary supplementation with phytosterols, plant sterols with structure and function similar to cholesterol, was able to rescue the effect of efavirenz administration on the auditory function. Altogether, our findings point towards the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in the inner ear as an innovative therapeutic strategy in preventing and/or delaying hearing loss.Copyright © 2023 Sodero et al.

When someone experiences this form of hearing impairment in both ears, they may be equipped with two separate CI devices, which will typically further improve the CI benefits. This spatial hearing is particularly crucial when tackling the challenge of understanding speech in noisy environments, a common issue CI users face. Currently, extensive research is dedicated to developing algorithms that can autonomously filter out undesired background noises from desired speech signals. At present, some research focuses on achieving end-to-end denoising, either as an integral component of the initial CI signal processing or by fully integrating the denoising process into the CI sound coding strategy. This work is presented in the context of bilateral CI (BiCI) systems, where we propose a deep-learning-based bilateral speech enhancement model that shares information between both hearing sides. Specifically, we connect two monaural end-to-end deep denoising sound coding techniques through intermediary latent fusion layers. These layers amalgamate the latent representations generated by these techniques by multiplying them together, resulting in an enhanced ability to reduce noise and improve learning generalization. The objective instrumental results demonstrate that the proposed fused BiCI sound coding strategy achieves higher interaural coherence, superior noise reduction, and enhanced predicted speech intelligibility scores compared to the baseline methods. Furthermore, our speech-in-noise intelligibility results in BiCI users reveal that the deep denoising sound coding strategy can attain scores similar to those achieved in quiet conditions.Copyright Authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1109%2fTBME.2024.3367530,SFX,38376983 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38376983]

Method(s): According to auditory sensitive period, collecting diffusion tensor imaging data of 109 SNHL children and 50 normal children, that were divided into group A (12-47 months) and group B (48-120 months), to construct the white matter network for graph theory analysis. The spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent imaging data of 38 SNHL and 21 control children, was combined with the sliding window and K-means clustering method to analyze their dynamic function connection by three temporal characteristics. Result(s): Group A showed a decrease in nodal parameters, while Group B showed obvious topological alterations of the structural network, reflected in the decrease in the global efficiency, the randomization of the small world attribute, and the decrease in connectivity between key brain regions. Besides, SNHL children had a higher fraction windows of the strong connection state but a smaller ones and shorter Mean Dwell Time of the weak connection state. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): SNHL Children should introduce hearing stimulation as early as possible before the sensitive period to avoid malformed brain remodelling.

DESIGN: A total of 174 ears with normal hearing and 388 ears with sensorineural hearing loss were studied. SFOAEs in the 0.3 to 4.3kHz frequency range were recorded using linearly swept tones at a rate of 2 Hz/msec, with stimulus level changing from 40 to 60 dB SPL in 10 dB steps. Four DL models were used to predict hearing thresholds at octave frequencies from 0.5 to 4kHz. The models-a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a hybrid CNN-k-nearest neighbor (KNN), a hybrid CNN-support vector machine (SVM), and a hybrid CNN-random forest (RF)-were individually built for each frequency. The input to the DL models was the measured raw SFOAE amplitude spectra and their corresponding signal to noise ratio spectra. All DL models shared a CNN-based feature self-extractor. They differed in that the conventional CNN utilized a fully connected layer to make the final regression decision, whereas the hybrid CNN-KNN, CNN-SVM, and CNN-RF models were designed by replacing the last fully connected layer of CNN model with a traditional machine learning (ML) regressor, that is, KNN, SVM, and RF, respectively. The model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error and SE averaged over 20 repetitions of 5x5 fold nested cross-validation. The performance of the proposed DL models was compared with two types of traditional ML models. RESULT(S): The proposed SFOAE-based DL models resulted in an optimal mean absolute error of 5.98, 5.22, 5.51, and 6.06 dB at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4kHz, respectively, superior to that obtained by the traditional ML models. The produced SEs were 8.55, 7.27, 7.58, and 7.95 dB at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4kHz, respectively. All the DL models outperformed any of the traditional ML models. CONCLUSION(S): The proposed swept-tone SFOAE-based DL models were capable of quantitatively predicting hearing thresholds with satisfactory performance. With DL techniques, the underlying relationship between SFOAEs and hearing thresholds at disparate frequencies was explored and captured, potentially improving the diagnostic value of SFOAEs.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A head/neck CT showed completely normal mastoid, middle ear and external auditory canal regions without any evidence of opacification or bone erosion. Otoscopic examination of the right ear disclosed aggregates of dried, brown, fibrillar material and debris occluding the external auditory canal and obstructing the otherwise intact tympanic membrane. Dilation of the external auditory canal or thickening of the tympanic membrane were not appreciated. The canal was debrided and the fibrillar material was placed in formalin. Histopathologic examination revealed numerous branching, septated fungal hyphae organized in densely-packed clusters. In other areas, the fungal hyphae abutted or were attached to lamellated collections of orthokeratin. As highlighted by GMS staining, the fungi were morphologically compatible with Aspergillus species. The clinicopathologic findings supported a diagnosis of fungal otitis externa, while the numerous anucleate squamous cells were compatible with colonization of an underlying, probably developing, cholesteatoma.

Furthermore, in analogy to lesion studies, phantom perception may serve as a vehicle to understand the fundamental processing principles underlying healthy auditory perception. With a special focus on tinnitus - as the prime example of auditory phantom perception - we review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology and neuroscience. In particular, we discuss why everyone with tinnitus suffers from (at least hidden) hearing loss, but not everyone with hearing loss suffers from tinnitus. We argue that intrinsic neural noise is generated and amplified along the auditory pathway as a compensatory mechanism to restore normal hearing based on adaptive stochastic resonance. The neural noise increase can then be misinterpreted as auditory input and perceived as tinnitus. This mechanism can be formalized in the Bayesian brain framework, where the percept (posterior) assimilates a prior prediction (brain's expectations) and likelihood (bottom-up neural signal). A higher mean and lower variance (i.e. enhanced precision) of the likelihood shifts the posterior, evincing a misinterpretation of sensory evidence, which may be further confounded by plastic changes in the brain that underwrite prior predictions. Hence, two fundamental processing principles provide the most explanatory power for the emergence of auditory phantom perceptions: predictive coding as a top-down and adaptive stochastic resonance as a complementary bottom-up mechanism. We conclude that both principles also play a crucial role in healthy auditory perception. Finally, in the context of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence, both processing principles may serve to improve contemporary machine learning techniques.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbrain%2fawad255,SFX,37503725 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37503725]

Accurate classification of IC neurons is vital for comprehending both normal and dysfunctional aspects of IC function. Various parameters, including dendritic morphology, neurotransmitter synthesis, potassium currents, biomarkers, and axonal targets, have been employed to identify distinct neuron types within the IC.

The ABR test is a method of testing for loss of hearing through electrical signals. Basically, the test is conducted on patients such as the elderly, the disabled, and infants who have difficulty in communication. This test has the advantage of being able to determine the presence or absence of objective hearing loss by brain stem reactions only, without any communication. This paper proposes the image preprocessing process required to construct an efficient graph image data set for deep learning models using auditory brainstem response data. To improve the performance of the deep learning model, we standardized the ABR image data measured on various devices with different forms. In addition, we applied the VGG16 model, a CNN-based deep learning network model developed by a research team at the University of Oxford, using preprocessed ABR data to classify the presence or absence of hearing loss and analyzed the accuracy of the proposed method. This experimental test was performed using 10,000 preprocessed data, and the model was tested with various weights to verify classification learning. Based on the learning results, we believe it is possible to help set the criteria for preprocessing and the learning process in medical graph data, including ABR graph data.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.3390%2fdiagnostics13233538,SFX,

However, it is of high importance since hearing loss is a growing problem due to aging population. Moreover, knowing these brain changes could help to understand some disappointing results with cochlear implant, and therefore could improve hearing rehabilitation. A systematic review and a coordinate-based meta-analysis were realized about the morphological brain changes highlighted by MRI in severe to profound hearing loss, congenital and acquired before or after language onset. 25 papers were included in our review, concerning more than 400 deaf subjects, most of them presenting prelingual deafness. The most consistent finding is a volumetric decrease in gray matter around bilateral auditory cortex. This change was confirmed by the coordinate-based meta-analysis which shows three converging clusters in this region. The visual areas of deaf children is also significantly impacted, with a decrease of the volume of both gray and white matters. Finally, deafness is responsible of a gray matter increase within the cerebellum, especially at the right side. These results are largely discussed and compared with those from deaf animal models and blind humans, which demonstrate for example a much more consistent gray matter decrease along their respective primary sensory pathway. In human deafness, a lot of other factors than deafness could interact on the brain plasticity. One of the most important is the use of sign language and its age of acquisition, which induce among others changes within the hand motor region and the visual cortex. But other confounding factors exist which have been too little considered in the current literature, such as the etiology of the hearing impairment, the speech-reading ability, the hearing aid use, the frequent associated vestibular dysfunction or neurocognitive impairment. Another important weakness highlighted by this review concern the lack of papers about postlingual deafness, whereas it represents most of the deaf population. Further studies are needed to better understand these issues, and finally try to improve deafness rehabilitation.Copyright © 2022 Gregoire, Deggouj, Dricot, Decat and Kupers.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.850245,SFX,

(Lagunin) Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow 119121, Russian Federation",Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) associated with mutations of the OTOF gene is one of the common types of sensorineural hearing loss of a hereditary nature. Due to its high genetic heterogeneity, ANSD is considered one of the most difficult hearing disorders to diagnose. The dataset from 270 known annotated single amino acid substitutions (SAV) related to ANSD was created. It was used to estimate the accuracy of pathogenicity prediction using the known (from dbNSFP4.4) method and a new one. The new method (ConStruct) for the creation of the protein-centric classification model is based on the use of Random Forest for the analysis of missense variants in exons of the OTOF gene. A system of predictor variables was developed based on the modern understanding of the structure and function of the otoferlin protein and reflecting the location of changes in the tertiary structure of the protein due to mutations in the OTOF gene. The conservation values of nucleotide substitutions in genomes of 100 vertebrates and 30 primates were also used as variables. The average prediction of balanced accuracy and the AUC value calculated by the 5-fold cross-validation procedure were 0.866 and 0.903, respectively. The model shows good results for interpreting data from the targeted sequencing of the OTOF gene and can be implemented as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of ANSD in the early stages of ontogenesis. The created model, together with the results of the pathogenicity prediction of SAVs via other known accurate methods, were used for the evaluation of a manually created set of 1302 VUS related to ANSD. Based on the analysis of predicted results, 16 SAVs were selected as the new most probable pathogenic variants.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.3390%2fijms242417240,SFX,38139069 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38139069]

Study Design: Retrospective predictive modeling study of prospectively collected single-institution CI dataset. Method(s): One hundred and seventy-five patients from a REDCap database including 761 patients >18 years who underwent CI and had audiometric testing preoperatively and one month after surgery were included. The primary outcome variable was the lowest quartile change in acoustic hearing at one month after CI using various formulae (standard pure tone average, SPTA; low-frequency PTA, LFPTA). Analysis involved applying multivariate logistic regression to detect statistical associations and training and testing supervised learning classifiers. Classifier performance was assessed with numerous metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Result(s): Lowest quartile change (indicating hearing preservation) in SPTA was positively associated with a history of meningitis, preoperative LFPTA, and preoperative SPTA. Lowest quartile change in SPTA was negatively associated with sudden hearing loss, noise exposure, aural fullness, and abnormal anatomy. Lowest quartile change in LFPTA was positively associated with preoperative LFPTA. Lowest quartile change in LFPTA was negatively associated with tobacco use. Random forest demonstrated the highest mean classification performance on the validation dataset when predicting each of the outcome variables. Conclusion(s): Machine learning demonstrated utility for predicting preservation of residual acoustic hearing in patients undergoing CI surgery, and the detected associations facilitated the interpretation of our machine-learning models. The models and statistical associations together may be used to facilitate improvements in shared clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

(Carlson) Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States",SAGE Publications Inc.,"Background and Purpose: The vestibular ganglion, or Scarpa's ganglion, is a cluster of afferent vestibular neurons within the internal auditory canal (IAC). There is minimal literature describing enhancement of this region on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its correlation to clinical symptoms. Here, we sought to find the prevalence of enhancement at Scarpa's ganglion, and determine whether such enhancement correlates with demographics or clinical symptoms. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review was performed of consecutive patients with an MRI of the IAC between 3/1/2021 and 5/20/2021. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed for T1 and FLAIR enhancement of the Scarpa's ganglion on post-contrast fat-saturated T1 and post-contrast FLAIR images. Discrepancies were agreed upon by consensus. Clinical variables (hearing loss, vestibular symptoms, tinnitus, and MRI indication) were gathered from a retrospective chart review. Result(s): Eighty-nine patients were included (51 female); the mean age was 58 (range 19-85). The most common MRI indication was hearing loss (n = 53). FLAIR enhancement was present on the right in 7 patients, on the left in 7 patients, and bilaterally in 6 patients. No enhancement was seen on post-contrast T1 images. There was no statistically significant correlation between consensus FLAIR on at least one side and age (p =.74), gender (p =.29), hearing loss (p =.32), hearing loss side (p =.39), type of hearing loss (p =.87), vestibular symptoms (p =.71), or tinnitus (p =.81). Conclusion(s): Enhancement is present in the minority of patients on post-contrast FLAIR images. If seen, it should be considered an uncommon but not unexpected finding with no clinical significance.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1177%2f19714009231224415,SFX,38226489 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38226489]

A secondary aim is to assess the performance of rule-based evaluations for predicting vestibular schwannomas using the largest dataset in the literature. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Seven hundred sixty seven adult patients with confirmed vestibular schwannoma and a pretreatment audiogram on file and 2000 randomly selected adult controls with audiograms. INTERVENTIONS: Audiometric data were analyzed using machine learning algorithms and standard rule-based criteria for defining asymmetric hearing loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the ability to identify patients with vestibular schwannomas based on audiometric data alone, using machine learning algorithms and rule-based formulas. The secondary outcome is the application of conventional rule-based formulas to a larger dataset using advanced computational techniques. RESULT(S): The machine learning algorithms had mildly improved specificity in some fields compared with rule-based evaluations and had similar sensitivity to previous rule-based evaluations in diagnosis of vestibular schwannomas. CONCLUSION(S): Machine learning algorithms perform similarly to rule-based evaluations in identifying patients with vestibular schwannomas based on audiometric data alone.

Conditions such as deafness and tinnitus exert a substantial impact on patients' overall quality of life, emphasizing the urgent need for precise and efficient classification methods. This study introduces an innovative approach, utilizing Multi-View Brain Network data acquired from three distinct cohorts: 51 deaf patients, 54 with tinnitus, and 42 normal controls. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording data were meticulously collected, focusing on 70 electrodes attached to an end-to-end key with 10 regions of interest (ROI). This data is synergistically integrated with machine learning algorithms. To tackle the inherently high-dimensional nature of brain connectivity data, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed for feature reduction, enhancing interpretability. The proposed approach undergoes evaluation using ensemble learning techniques, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost. The performance of the proposed models is scrutinized across a comprehensive set of metrics, encompassing cross-validation accuracy (CVA), precision, recall, F1-score, Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The proposed models demonstrate statistical significance and effectively diagnose auditory disorders, contributing to early detection and personalized treatment, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. Notably, they exhibit reliability and robustness, characterized by high Kappa and MCC values.

The classic method of manual counting is tedious, and, although stereology approaches can be faster, they can only be used to estimate total cell numbers per cochlea. Here, a machine-learning algorithm that automatically identifies, counts, and maps the SGCs in digitized images of semi-serial human temporal-bone sections not only speeds the analysis, with no loss of accuracy, but also allows 3D visualization of the SGCs and fine-grained mapping to cochlear frequency. Applying the algorithm to 62 normal-aging human ears shows significantly faster degeneration of SGCs in the basal than the apical half of the cochlea. Comparison to fiber counts in the same ears shows that the fraction of surviving SGCs lacking a peripheral axon steadily increases with age, reaching more than 50% in the apical cochlea and almost 66% in basal regions.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Association for Research in Otolaryngology.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1007%2fs10162-023-00909-y,SFX,37957485 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37957485]

Despite being a well-known tool for ARHL evaluation, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening version (HHIE-S) has only traditionally been used for direct screening using self-reported outcomes. This work uses a novel integration of machine learning approaches to improve the predicted accuracy of the HHIE-S tool for ARHL in older adults. Method(s): We employed a dataset that was gathered between 2016 and 2018 and included 1,526 senior citizens from several Taipei City Hospital branches. 80% of the data were used for training (n = 1220) and 20% were used for testing (n = 356). XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM were among the machine learning models that were only used and assessed on the training set. In order to prevent data leakage and overfitting, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model-which had the greatest AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.81-0.85)-was then only used on the holdout testing data. Result(s): On the testing set, the LGBM model showed a strong AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.86), far outperforming conventional techniques. Notably, several HHIE-S items and age were found to be significant characteristics. In contrast to traditional HHIE research, which concentrates on the psychological effects of hearing loss, this study combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques-specifically, the LGBM classifier-with the HHIE-S tool. The incorporation of SHAP values enhances the interpretability of the model's predictions and provides a more comprehensive comprehension of the significance of various aspects. Conclusion(s): Our methodology highlights the great potential that arises from combining machine learning with validated hearing evaluation instruments such as the HHIE-S. Healthcare practitioners can anticipate ARHL more accurately thanks to this integration, which makes it easier to intervene quickly and precisely.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1186%2fs13040-023-00351-z,SFX,

No brain regions showed hypermetabolism in the NIHL subjects. In metabolic connectivity analysis, NIHL subjects showed decreased average strength, global efficiency, local efficiency, and mean clustering coefficient when compared with normal subjects.

Despite evidence from our lab and others about its polygenic nature, little is known about the specific genes, cell types, and pathways involved in ARHL, impeding the development of therapeutic interventions. In this manuscript, we describe, for the first time, the complete cell-type specific transcriptome of the aging mouse cochlea using snRNA-seq in an outbred mouse model in relation to auditory threshold variation. Cochlear cell types were identified using unsupervised clustering and annotated via a three-tiered approach-first by linking to expression of known marker genes, then using the NSForest algorithm to select minimum cluster-specific marker genes and reduce dimensional feature space for statistical comparison of our clusters with existing publicly-available data sets on the gEAR website,1 and finally, by validating and refining the annotations using Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) and the cluster-specific marker genes as probes. We report on 60 unique cell-types expanding the number of defined cochlear cell types by more than two times. Importantly, we show significant specific cell type increases and decreases associated with loss of hearing acuity implicating specific subsets of hair cell subtypes, ganglion cell subtypes, and cell subtypes within the stria vascularis in this model of ARHL.

However, the reasons for this are unclear. Purpose(s): This study assessed data-logged and self-reported amount of hearing aid use in a clinical sample of hearing aid users. It identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport. Research Design: This observational study recruited adult hearing aid users from 22 private dispensers in the Netherlands and in Denmark. Study Sample: The sample consisted of 228 hearing aid users. Typical participants were over the age of 65 and retired, were fitted binaurally, and had financially contributed to the cost of their hearing aids. Participants had on average a mild-to-severe sloping bilateral hearing impairment. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants completed a purposefully designed questionnaire regarding hearing aid usage and the International Outcome Inventory-Hearing Aids. Dispensers collected audiometric results and data logging. Multiple linear regression identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport when controlling for covariates. Result(s): Data logging showed on average 10.5 hr of hearing aid use (n 5 184), while participants reported on average 11.8 hr of daily hearing aid use (n 5 206). In participants for which both data-logged and self-reported hearing aid use data were available (n 5 166), the average absolute overreport of daily hearing aid use was 1.2 (1 hr and 11 min). Relative overreport was expressed as a rate of absolute overreport divided by data-logged hearing aid use. A positive rate denotes hearing aid use overreport: the average overreport rate was.38. Cluster analysis identified two data-logged patterns: ""Regular,"" where hearing aids are typically switched on for between 12 and 20 hr before their user powers them off (57% of the sample), and ""On-off,"" where hearing aids are typically switched on for shorter periods of time before being powered off (43% of the sample). In terms of self-report, 77% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be the same every day, while 23% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be different from day to day. Participants for whom data logging showed an On-off pattern or who reported their hearing aid use to be different from day to day had significantly fewer data-logged and self-reported hours of hearing aid use. Having an On-off data-logging pattern or describing hearing aid use as the same every day was associated with a significantly greater hearing aid use overreport. Conclusion(s): Data-logged and self-reported usage patterns significantly predicted data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and overreport when controlling for covariates. The results point to patterns of hearing aid usage as being at least as important a concept as amount of hearing aid use.

A paired comparison paradigm was used in which participants listened to pairs of speech-in-noise stimuli processed by NR with 10 different strength settings. Participants indicated their preferred sound sample. The 30 participants were divided into three groups according to hearing status (normal hearing, mild hearing loss, and moderate hearing loss). The results showed that (1) participants with moderate hearing loss preferred stronger NR than participants with normal hearing; (2) cluster analysis based solely on the preference for NR strength showed that the data could be described well by dividing the participants into three preference clusters; (3) the appropriate cluster membership could be found with 15 paired comparisons. We conclude that on average, a higher hearing loss is related to a preference for stronger NR, at least for our NR algorithm and our participants.

Specifically, it has been shown that high-frequency sounds are processed in the anterior region of the auditory cortex, while low-frequency sounds are processed in its posterior region. This tonotopic organization is important for the brain to efficiently process different aspects of auditory information and is likely conserved across species. Nevertheless, these studies have not permitted the detection of the complete distribution of sound frequency perception across the rodent auditory system. In this study we used 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in awake rats to study how different frequencies are processed and represented by the brain. Here, 4 different frequencies (7.5, 15, 38 and 46 kHz) were presented during two different recording sessions - 2 frequencies per session. In the same animal we could detect hierarchical and tonotopic organization from subcortical through cortical levels: whole-brain clusters of activity, identified auditory regions and sub-regions involved in auditory perception of pure frequencies. We show that auditory stimulation of awake rats leads to consistent and robust levels of brain activation which, opens up the possibility to use this method to examine complex auditory perception and to conduct longitudinal and translational studies, which could be used in the observation of presbycusis, or in the optimization of hearing prosthetics.

The combination of technical data on hearing aids and individual rehabilitation needs can give insight into the factors that contribute to the success of rehabilitation. This study sets out to investigate if different subgroups of (comparable) hearing aids lead to differences in the success of rehabilitation, and whether these differences vary between different domains of auditory functioning. DESIGN: This study explored the advantages of including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in the process of purchasing new hearing aids in a large sample of successful hearing aid users. Subject data were obtained from 64 (commercial) hearing aid dispensers and 10 (noncommercial) audiological centers in the Netherlands. The PROM was a 32-item questionnaire and was used to determine the success of rehabilitation using hearing aids by measuring auditory disability over time. The items were mapped on six domains of auditory functioning: detection, discrimination, localization, speech in quiet, speech in noise, and noise tolerance, encompassing a variety of daily-life listening situations. Hearing aids were grouped by means of cluster analysis, resulting in nine subgroups. In total, 1149 subjects were included in this study. A general linear model was used to model the final PROM results. Model results were analyzed via a multifactor Analysis of Variance. Post hoc analyses provided detailed information on model variables. RESULT(S): Results showed a strong statistically significant effect of hearing aids on self-perceived auditory functioning in general. Clinically relevant differences were found for auditory domains including detection, speech in quiet, speech in noise, and localization. There was only a small, but significant, effect of the different subgroups of hearing aids on the final PROM results, where no differences were found between the auditory domains. Minor differences were found between results obtained in commercial and noncommercial settings, or between novice and experienced users. Severity of Hearing loss, age, gender, and hearing aid style (i.e., behind-the-ear versus receiver-in-canal type) did not have a clinically relevant effect on the final PROM results. CONCLUSION(S): The use of hearing aids has a large positive effect on self-perceived auditory functioning. There was however no salient effect of the different subgroups of hearing aids on the final PROM results, indicating that technical properties of hearing aids only play a limited role in this respect. This study challenges the belief that premium devices outperform basic ones, highlighting the need for personalized rehabilitation strategies and the importance of evaluating factors contributing to successful rehabilitation for clinical practice.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Certain rural populations are at higher risk for infection-related hearing loss. For Alaska Native children, historical data on hearing loss prevalence suggest a higher burden of infection-related hearing loss, but updated prevalence data are urgently needed in this high-risk population. DESIGN: Hearing data were collected as part of two school-based cluster-randomized trials in 15 communities in rural northwest Alaska over two academic years (2017-2019). All enrolled children from preschool to 12th grade were eligible. Pure-tone thresholds were obtained using standard audiometry and conditioned play when indicated. The analysis included the first available audiometric assessment for each child (n = 1634 participants, 3 to 21 years), except for the high-frequency analysis, which was limited to year 2 when higher frequencies were collected. Multiple imputation was used to quantify the prevalence of hearing loss in younger children, where missing data were more frequent due to the need for behavioral responses. Hearing loss in either ear was evaluated using both the former World Health Organization (WHO) definition (pure-tone average [PTA] > 25 dB) and the new WHO definition (PTA >= 20 dB), which was published after the study. Analyses with the new definition were limited to children 7 years and older due to incomplete data obtained on younger children at lower thresholds. RESULT(S): The overall prevalence of hearing loss (PTA > 25 dB; 0.5, 1, 2, 4kHz) was 10.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9 to 12.1). Hearing loss was predominately mild (PTA >25 to 40 dB; 8.9%, 95% CI, 7.4 to 10.5). The prevalence of unilateral hearing loss was 7.7% (95% CI, 6.3 to 9.0). Conductive hearing loss (air-bone gap of >= 10 dB) was the most common hearing loss type (9.1%, 95% CI, 7.6 to 10.7). Stratified by age, hearing loss (PTA >25 dB) was more common in children 3 to 6 years (14.9%, 95% CI, 11.4 to 18.5) compared to children 7 years and older (8.7%, 95% CI, 7.1 to 10.4). In children 7 years and older, the new WHO definition increased the prevalence of hearing loss to 23.4% (95% CI, 21.0 to 25.8) compared to the former definition (8.7%, 95% CI, 7.1 to 10.4). Middle ear disease prevalence was 17.6% (95% CI, 15.7 to 19.4) and was higher in younger children (23.6%, 95% CI, 19.7 to 27.6) compared to older children (15.2%, 95% CI, 13.2 to 17.3). High-frequency hearing loss (4, 6, 8kHz) was present in 20.5% (95% CI, 18.4 to 22.7 [PTA >25 dB]) of all children and 22.8% (95% CI, 20.3 to 25.3 [PTA >25 dB]) and 29.7% (95% CI, 27.0 to 32.4 [PTA >= 20 dB]) of children 7 years and older (limited to year 2). CONCLUSION(S): This analysis represents the first prevalence study on childhood hearing loss in Alaska in over 60 years and is the largest cohort with hearing data ever collected in rural Alaska. Our results highlight that hearing loss continues to be common in rural Alaska Native children, with middle ear disease more prevalent in younger children and high-frequency hearing loss more prevalent with increasing age. Prevention efforts may benefit from managing hearing loss type by age. Lastly, continued research is needed on the impact of the new WHO definition of hearing loss on field studies.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

It seriously affects the cognitive function and quality of life of the elderly. This study is based on comprehensive bioinformatic and machine learning methods to identify the critical genes of ARHL and explore its therapy targets and pathological mechanisms. The ARHL and normal samples were from GSE49543 datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to obtain significant modules. The Limma R-package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The 15 common genes of the practical module and DEGs were screened. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that these genes were mainly associated with inflammation, immune response, and infection. Cytoscape software created the protein-protein interaction (PPI) layouts and cytoHubba, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and random forests (RF) algorithms screened hub genes. After validating the hub gene expressions in GSE6045 and GSE154833 datasets, Clec4n, Mpeg1, and Fcgr3 are highly expressed in ARHL and have higher diagnostic efficacy for ARHL, so they were identified as hub genes. In conclusion, Clec4n, Mpeg1, and Fcgr3 play essential roles in developing ARHL, and they might become vital targets in ARHL diagnosis and anti-inflammatory therapy.Copyright © 2023",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2023.108894,SFX,37844444 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37844444]

Method(s): A group of 40 children aged up to 2 years with DFNB1-related congenital deafness was observed in this prospective cohort study over three follow-up intervals (0, 8, and 18 months) after cochlear implant (CI) activation. Children were assessed for auditory development using the LittlEARS Questionnaire (LEAQ) score, and at the same time, measurements were made of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plasma levels. Result(s): There were significant negative correlations between plasma levels of MMP-9 at 8-month follow-up and LEAQ score at cochlear implantation (p = 0.04) and LEAQ score at 18-month follow-up (p = 0.02) and between MMP-9 plasma levels at 18-month follow-up and LEAQ score at cochlear implantation (p = 0.04). As already reported, we confirmed a significant negative correlation between MMP-9 plasma level at cochlear implantation and LEAQ score at 18-month follow-up (p = 0.005). Based on this latter correlation, two clusters of good and poor CI performers could be isolated. Conclusion(s): The study shows that children born deaf who have an MMP-9 plasma level of less than 150 ng/ml at cochlear implantation have a good chance of attaining a high LEAQ score after 18 months of speech and language rehabilitation. This indicates that MMP-9 plasma level at cochlear implantation is a good prognostic marker for CI outcome.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1007%2fs00405-023-07924-y,SFX,37004521 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37004521]

This study retrospectively analyzed hearing test results from elderly patients experiencing vertigo and dizziness at ENT outpatient over a 10-year period, in order to study the patterns of hearing loss in this patient population. Method(s): Nine thousand three hundred eighty four patients over 50 years old underwent retrospective collection and screening of outpatient diagnosis, pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance measurement (tympanogram) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) test. The patient's audiograms are divided into 7 subtypes according to a set of fixed criteria. Meanwhile, K-Means clustering analysis method was used to classify the audiogram. Result(s): The Jerger classification of tympanogram in elderly patients with vertigo and dizziness showed the majority falling under type A. The leading audiogram shapes were flat (27.81% in right ear and 26.89% in left ear), high-frequency gently sloping (25.97% in right ear and 27.34% in left ear), and high-frequency steeply sloping (21.60% in right ear and 22.53% in left ear). Meniere's disease (MD; 30.87%), benign recurrent vertigo (BRV; 19.07%), and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; 15.66%) were the most common etiologies in elderly vestibular diseases. We observed statistically significant differences in hearing thresholds among these vestibular diseases (P < 0.001). K-Means clustering analysis suggested that the optimal number of clusters was three, with sample sizes for the three clusters being 2,747, 2,413, and 4,139, respectively. The ANOVA statistical results of each characteristic value showed P < 0.001. Conclusion(s): The elderly patients often have mild to moderate hearing loss as a concomitant symptom with vertigo. Female patients have better hearing thresholds than males. The dominant audiometric shapes in this patient population were flat, high-frequency gently sloping, and high-frequency steeply sloping according to a set of fixed criteria. This study highlights the need for tailored strategies in managing hearing loss in elderly patients with vertigo and dizziness.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Chen, Hong, Liu, Du, Wu, Cheng and Ji.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3389%2ffnagi.2023.1225786,SFX,

In humans, severe hearing loss is often accompanied by alterations to other neural systems, such as the vestibular system; however, the inter-relations are not well understood. The overall goal of this study was to assess vestibular-related functioning proxies in a rat CHL model. Method(s): Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N=134, 250g, 2months old) were used in a CHL model which produced a >20dB threshold shift induced by tympanic membrane puncture. Auditory brainstem response (ABRs) recordings were used to determine threshold depth at different times before and after CHL. ABR threshold depths were assessed both manually and by an automated ABR machine learning algorithm. Vestibular-related functioning proxy assessment was performed using the rotarod, balance beam, elevator vertical motion (EVM) and Ferris-wheel rotation (FWR) assays. Result(s): The Pre-CHL (control) threshold depth was 27.92dB+/-11.58dB compared to the Post-CHL threshold depth of 50.69dB+/-13.98dB (mean+/-SD) across the frequencies tested. The automated ABR machine learning algorithm determined the following threshold depths: Pre-CHL=24.3dB, Post-CHL same day=56dB, Post-CHL 7 days=41.16dB, and Post-CHL 1 month=32.5dB across the frequencies assessed (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32kHz). Rotarod assessment of motor function was not significantly different between pre and post-CHL (~1week) rats for time duration (sec) or speed (RPM), albeit the former had a small effect size difference. Balance beam time to transverse was significantly longer for post-CHL rats, likely indicating a change in motor coordination. Further, failure to cross was only noted for CHL rats. The defection count was significantly reduced for CHL rats compared to control rats following FWR, but not EVM. The total distance traveled during open-field examination after EVM was significantly different between control and CHL rats, but not for FWR. The EVM is associated with linear acceleration (acting in the vertical plane: up-down) stimulating the saccule, while the FWR is associated with angular acceleration (centrifugal rotation about a circular axis) stimulating both otolith organs and semicircular canals; therefore, the difference in results could reflect the specific vestibular-organ functional role. Discussion(s): Less movement (EVM) and increase time to transverse (balance beam) may be associated with anxiety and alterations to defecation patterns (FWR) may result from autonomic disturbances due to the impact of hearing loss. In this regard, vestibulomotor deficits resulting in changes in balance and motion could be attributed to comodulation of auditory and vestibular functioning. Future studies should manipulate vestibular functioning directly in rats with CHL.Copyright © 2023 Manno, Cheung, Basnet, Khan, Mao, Pan, Ma, Cho, Tian, An, Feng, Cai, Pienkowski and Lau.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2023.1057551,SFX,

Although the primary aim of wearing face masks is to protect against viral transmission, they pose a potential burden on communication. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the state of the evidence of the effect of facial coverings on acoustic and perceptual speech outcomes. The scoping review followed the framework created by Arksey & O'Malley (2005) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines (PRISMA-ScR; Tricco et al., 2018). The search was completed in May 2021 across the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 3,846 records were retrieved from the database search. Following the removal of duplicates, 3,479 remained for the title/abstract screen and 149 were selected for the full-text review. Of these, 52 were included in the final review and relevant data were extracted. The 52 articles included in the final review consisted of; 11 studied perceptual outcomes only, 16 studied acoustic outcomes only, and 14 studied both perceptual and acoustic outcomes. 13 of these investigated acoustic features that could be used for mask classification. Although the findings varied from article to article, many trends stood out. Many articles revealed that face masks act as a low pass filter, dampening sounds at higher frequencies; however, the frequency range and the degree of attenuation varied based on face mask type. All but five articles that reported on perceptual outcomes showed a common trend that wearing a face mask was associated with poorer speech intelligibility. The findings of the scoping review provided evidence that facial coverings negatively impacted speech intelligibility, which is likely due to a combination of auditory and visual cue degradation. Due to the continued prevalence of mask use, how facial coverings affect a wider variety of speaker populations, such as those with communication impairments, and strategies for overcoming communication challenges should be explored.Copyright © 2023 Badh, Knowles.

Lack of standardized screening, awareness, cost, and access to hearing testing present barriers to HL identification. To facilitate prescreening and selection of patients who warrant audiometric evaluation, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict speech-frequency pure-tone average (PTA). Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Method(s): The cohort included 8918 adults (>=20 years) who completed audiometric testing with NHANES (2012-2018). The primary outcome measure was the prediction of better hearing ear speech-frequency PTA. Relevant predictors included demographics, medical conditions, and subjective assessment of hearing. Supervised ML with a tree-based architecture was used. Regression performance was determined by the mean absolute error (MAE) with binary classification assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Result(s): Using the full set of predictors, the test set MAE between the ML-predicted and actual PTA was 5.29 dB HL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.97-5.61). The 5 most influential predictors of higher PTA were increased age, worse subjective hearing, male gender, increased body mass index, and history of smoking. The 5-factor abbreviated model performed comparably to the extended feature set with MAE 5.36 (95% CI: 5.03-5.69) and AUC for PTA > 25 dB HL of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94). Conclusion(s): The ML model was able to predict PTA with patient demographics, clinical factors, and subjective hearing status.

(Elmer, Giroud) Competence center Language & Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland",Academic Press Inc.,"Healthy aging is often associated with speech comprehension difficulties in everyday life situations despite a pure-tone hearing threshold in the normative range. Drawing on this background, we used a multidimensional approach to assess the functional and structural neural correlates underlying age-related temporal speech processing while controlling for pure-tone hearing acuity. Accordingly, we combined structural magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, and collected behavioral data while younger and older adults completed a phonetic categorization and discrimination task with consonant-vowel syllables varying along a voice-onset time continuum. The behavioral results confirmed age-related temporal speech processing singularities which were reflected in a shift of the boundary of the psychometric categorization function, with older adults perceiving more syllable characterized by a short voice-onset time as /ta/ compared to younger adults. Furthermore, despite the absence of any between-group differences in phonetic discrimination abilities, older adults demonstrated longer N100/P200 latencies as well as increased P200 amplitudes while processing the consonant-vowel syllables varying in voice-onset time. Finally, older adults also exhibited a divergent anatomical gray matter infrastructure in bilateral auditory-related and frontal brain regions, as manifested in reduced cortical thickness and surface area. Notably, in the younger adults but not in the older adult cohort, cortical surface area in these two gross anatomical clusters correlated with the categorization of consonant-vowel syllables characterized by a short voice-onset time, suggesting the existence of a critical gray matter threshold that is crucial for consistent mapping of phonetic categories varying along the temporal dimension. Taken together, our results highlight the multifaceted dimensions of age-related temporal speech processing characteristics, and pave the way toward a better understanding of the relationships between hearing, speech and the brain in older age.Copyright © 2023 The Authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2023.120285,SFX,37481009 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37481009]

Although several approaches for learning EEG signal characteristics have been established earlier, the hybridization concept has rarely been explored to produce novel representations of AEP features and achieve further performance enhancement for AEP signals. Moreover, the classification of auditory attention within a concise time interval is still facing some challenges. To address this concern, this study has proposed a hybridization scheme, represented as a hybrid convoluted k-nearest neighbour (CKNN) algorithm, consisting of concatenating the convolutional layer of CNN with k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier. The proposed architecture helps in improving the accuracy of KNN from 83.23% to 92.26% with a 3-second decision window. The effect of several concise decision windows is also investigated in this analysis. The proposed architecture is validated by a publicly benchmark AEP dataset, and the outcomes indicate that the CKNN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques with a concise decision window. The proposed framework shows superior performance in a concise decision window that can be effectively used for early hearing deficiency diagnosis. This paper also presents several discoveries that could be helpful to the neurological community.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.neuri.2021.100037,SFX,

(de Vries) GN Hearing, Eindhoven, Netherlands",Frontiers Media SA,"Pure-tone audiometry-the process of estimating a person's hearing threshold from ""audible"" and ""inaudible"" responses to tones of varying frequency and intensity-is the basis for diagnosing and quantifying hearing loss. By taking a probabilistic modeling approach, both optimal tone selection (in terms of expected information gain) and hearing threshold estimation can be derived through Bayesian inference methods. The performance of probabilistic model-based audiometry methods is directly linked to the quality of the underlying model. In recent years, Gaussian process (GP) models have been shown to provide good results in this context. We present methods to improve the efficiency of GP-based audiometry procedures by improving the underlying model. Instead of a single GP, we propose to use a GP mixture model that can be conditioned on side-information about the subject. The underlying idea is that one can typically distinguish between different types of hearing thresholds, enabling a mixture model to better capture the statistical properties of hearing thresholds among a population. Instead of modeling all hearing thresholds by a single GP, a mixture model allows specific types of hearing thresholds to be modeled by independent GP models. Moreover, the mixing coefficients can be conditioned on side-information such as age and gender, capturing the correlations between age, gender, and hearing threshold. We show how a GP mixture model can be optimized for a specific target population by learning the parameters from a data set containing annotated audiograms. We also derive an optimal tone selection method based on greedy information gain maximization, as well as hearing threshold estimation through Bayesian inference. The proposed models are fitted to a data set containing roughly 176 thousand annotated audiograms collected in the Nordic countries. We compare the predictive accuracies of optimized mixture models of varying sizes with that of an optimized single-GP model. The usefulness of the optimized models is tested in audiometry simulations. Simulation results indicate that an optimized GP mixture model can significantly outperform an optimized single-GP model in terms of predictive accuracy, and leads to significant increases the efficiency of the resulting Bayesian audiometry procedure.© Copyright © 2021 Cox and de Vries.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3389%2ffdgth.2021.723348,SFX,

(Souza) Knowles Hearing Center, Evanston, IL, United States",Frontiers Media SA,"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was mounting interest in remote testing solutions for audiology. The ultimate goal of such work was to improve access to hearing healthcare for individuals that might be unable or reluctant to seek audiological help in a clinic. In 2015, Diane Van Tasell patented a method for measuring an audiogram when the precise signal level was unknown (patent US 8,968,209 B2). In this method, the slope between pure-tone thresholds measured at 2 and 4 kHz is calculated and combined with questionnaire information in order to reconstruct the most likely audiograms from a database of options. An approach like the Van Tasell method is desirable because it is quick and feasible to do in a patient's home where exact stimulus levels are unknown. The goal of the present study was to use machine learning to assess the effectiveness of such audiogram-estimation methods. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a database of audiologic and demographic information, was used to train and test several machine learning algorithms. Overall, 9,256 cases were analyzed. Audiometric data were classified using the Wisconsin Age-Related Hearing Impairment Classification Scale (WARHICS), a method that places hearing loss into one of eight categories. Of the algorithms tested, a random forest machine learning algorithm provided the best fit with only a few variables: the slope between 2 and 4 kHz; gender; age; military experience; and self-reported hearing ability. Using this method, 54.79% of the individuals were correctly classified, 34.40% were predicted to have a milder loss than measured, and 10.82% were predicted to have a more severe loss than measured. Although accuracy was low, it is unlikely audibility would be severely affected if classifications were used to apply gains. Based on audibility calculations, underamplification still provided sufficient gain to achieve ~95% correct (Speech Intelligibility Index >= 0.45) for sentence materials for 88% of individuals. Fewer than 1% of individuals were overamplified by 10 dB for any audiometric frequency. Given these results, this method presents a promising direction toward remote assessment; however, further refinement is needed before use in clinical fittings.© Copyright © 2021 Ellis and Souza.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3389%2ffdgth.2021.723533,SFX,

Confidence levels as to the type of errors being made remain low because mistranslations from speech to text are not always captured with a note that details the reason for the error. There have been situations in higher education where students requiring captions and transcriptions have found that some academic lecture results are littered with word errors which means that comprehension levels drop and those with cognitive, physical and sensory disabilities are particularly affected. Despite the incredible improvements in general understanding of conversational automatic speech recognition, academic situations tend to include numerous domain specific terms and the lecturers may be non-native speakers, coping with recording technology in noisy situations.

Methods Forty-five patients with unilateral hearing impairment[12 males and 33 females, aged 36-67 (46.0+/-9.7) years], and 31 controls with normal hearing[9 males and 22 females, aged 36-67 (46.0+/-10.1) years], were retrospectively included. All subjects underwent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution T1-weighted imaging. The patients were divided into the left-sided hearing impaired group(24 cases), and the right-sided hearing impaired group(21 cases). After data being preprocessed, differences in low frequency amplitude (ALFF) metrics between the evaluated patients and controls were calculated and analyzed, and the statistics were corrected for Gaussian random field (GFR). Results Overall comparative analysis of patients with hearing impairment showed that one-way ANOVA among the three groups showed abnormal ALFF values only in the right anterior cuneiform lobe (GRF adjusted P=0.002). The ALFF value of the hearing impaired group was higher than that of the control group in one cluster (peak coordinates: X=9, Y=-72, Z=48, T=5.82), involving the left occipital gyrus, right anterior cuneiform lobe, left superior cuneiform lobe, left superior parietal gyrus, and left angular gyrus (GRF adjusted P=0.031). The ALFF value of the hearing impaired group was lower than that of the control group in three clusters (peak coordinates: X=57, Y=-48, Z=-24; T=-4.99; X=45, Y=-66, Z=0, T=-4.06; X=42, Y=-12, Z=36, T=-4.03), involving the right inferior temporal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the right precentral gyrus (GRF adjusted P=0.009). Compared with the control group, the ALFF value of the left hearing impairment group was significantly higher than that of the control group in one cluster (peak coordinates: X=-12, Y=-75, Z=45, T=5.78), involving the left anterior cuneiform lobe, right anterior cuneiform lobe, left middle occipital gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left cuneiform lobe, and right cuneiform lobe (P=0.023 after GRF correction). Compared with the control group, the right hearing impairment group had a significantly higher ALFF value in one cluster (peak coordinates: X=9, Y=-46, Z=22, T=6.06), involving the left middle occipital gyrus, right anterior cuneiform lobe, left cuneiform lobe, right cuneiform lobe, left superior occipital gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus (GRF adjusted P=0.022); The brain area with reduced ALFF values is located in the right inferior temporal gyrus (GRF adjusted P=0.029). Spearman's two-tailed correlation analysis between ALFF values and pure tone average in the abnormal brain regions showed that ALFF values in the abnormal brain regions correlated to some extent with the pure tone average (PTA) only in the left-sided hearing impaired group(PTA=2 000 Hz, r=0.318,P= 0.033; PTA=4 000 Hz, r=0.386, P=0.009).

Nevertheless, tinnitus has traditionally been studied in isolation without necessarily considering auditory ghosting and hearing loss as part of the same syndrome. Hence, in the present neuroanatomical study, we attempted to pave the way toward a better understanding of the tinnitus syndrome, and compared two groups of almost perfectly matched individuals with (TIHL) and without (NTHL) pure-tone tinnitus, but both characterized by pure-tone hearing loss. The two groups were homogenized in terms of sample size, age, gender, handedness, education, and hearing loss. Furthermore, since the assessment of pure-tone hearing thresholds alone is not sufficient to describe the full spectrum of hearing abilities, the two groups were also harmonized for supra-threshold hearing estimates which were collected using temporal compression, frequency selectivity und speech-in-noise tasks. Regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses based on key brain structures identified in previous neuroimaging studies showed that the TIHL group exhibited increased cortical volume (CV) and surface area (CSA) of the right supramarginal gyrus and posterior planum temporale (PT) as well as CSA of the left middle-anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The TIHL group also demonstrated larger volumes of the left amygdala and of the left head and body of the hippocampus. Notably, vertex-wise multiple linear regression analyses additionally brought to light that CSA of a specific cluster, which was located in the left middle-anterior part of the STS and overlapped with the one found to be significant in the between-group analyses, was positively associated with tinnitus distress level. Furthermore, distress also positively correlated with CSA of gray matter vertices in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex and the right posterior STS, whereas tinnitus duration was positively associated with CSA and CV of the right angular gyrus (AG) and posterior part of the STS. These results provide new insights into the critical gray matter architecture of the tinnitus syndrome matrix responsible for the emergence, maintenance and distress of auditory phantom sensations.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1007%2fs00429-023-02669-0,SFX,37349539 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37349539]

It contains a sophisticated speech processor that analyzes and transforms the acoustic input. It distributes its time-enveloped spectral content to the auditory nerve as electrical pulsed stimulation trains of selected frequency channels on a multi-contact electrode that is surgically inserted in the cochlear duct. This remarkable brain interface enables the deaf to regain hearing and understand speech. However, tuning of the large (>50) number of parameters of the speech processor, so-called ""device fitting,"" is a tedious and complex process, which is mainly carried out in the clinic through 'one-size-fits-all' procedures. Current fitting typically relies on limited and often subjective data that must be collected in limited time. Despite the success of the CI as a hearing-restoration device, variability in speech-recognition scores among users is still very large, and mostly unexplained. The major factors that underly this variability incorporate three levels: (i) variability in auditory-system malfunction of CI-users, (ii) variability in the selectivity of electrode-to-auditory nerve (EL-AN) activation, and (iii) lack of objective perceptual measures to optimize the fitting. We argue that variability in speech recognition can only be alleviated by using objective patient-specific data for an individualized fitting procedure, which incorporates knowledge from all three levels. In this paper, we propose a series of experiments, aimed at collecting a large amount of objective (i.e., quantitative, reproducible, and reliable) data that characterize the three processing levels of the user's auditory system. Machine-learning algorithms that process these data will eventually enable the clinician to derive reliable and personalized characteristics of the user's auditory system, the quality of EL-AN signal transfer, and predictions of the perceptual effects of changes in the current fitting.Copyright © 2023 Van Opstal and Noordanus.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2023.1183126,SFX,

Behavioural evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia affects statistical learning. However, surprisingly few studies have assessed how developmental dyslexia affects the neural processing underlying this type of learning. We used electroencephalography to explore the neural correlates of an important aspect of statistical learning - sensitivity to transitional probabilities - in individuals with developmental dyslexia. Adults diagnosed with developmental dyslexia (n = 17) and controls (n = 19) were exposed to a continuous stream of sound triplets. Every so often, a triplet ending had a low transitional probability given the triplet's first two sounds (""statistical deviants""). Furthermore, every so often a triplet ending was presented from a deviant location (""acoustic deviants""). We examined mismatch negativity elicited by statistical deviants (sMMN), and MMN elicited by location deviants (i.e., acoustic changes). Acoustic deviants elicited a MMN which was larger in the control group than in the developmental dyslexia group. Statistical deviants elicited a small, yet significant, sMMN in the control group, but not in the developmental dyslexia group. However, the difference between the groups was not significant. Our findings indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying pre-attentive acoustic change detection and implicit statistical auditory learning are both affected in developmental dyslexia.Copyright © 2023 The Authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.biopsycho.2023.108592,SFX,37268263 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37268263]

The principal aim of the present study was to evaluate vocal singing skills in Italian pediatric CI users. A further aim was to investigate factors that may significantly influence their performance. Method(s): The participants were twenty-two implanted children and twenty-two hearing peers. Their vocal singing skills for familiar (""Happy Birthday to You"") and unfamiliar songs (""Baton Twirler"" from Pam Pam 2- Tribute to Gordon) were evaluated in relation to their music perception (the Gordon test). Acoustic analysis was performed using Praat and MATLAB software. Nonparametric statistical tests and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the data. Result(s): Hearing children outperformed implanted peers in both music perception and vocal singing tasks (all measures regarding intonation, vocal range, melody, and memory for the familiar song versus measures regarding intonation and overall melody production for the unfamiliar song). Music perception and vocal singing performances revealed strong correlations. For the familiar and unfamiliar songs, age-appropriate vocal singing was observed in 27.3% versus 45.4% of children, all implanted within 24 months of age. Age at implantation and duration of CI experience were moderately correlated with the total score obtained from the Gordon test. Conclusion(s): Implanted children show limited vocal singing skills in comparison to their hearing peers. However, some children implanted within 24 months of age seem to achieve vocal singing skills as good as their hearing peers. Future research could be useful to better understand the role of brain plasticity to implement specific training programs for both music perception and vocal singing.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.ijporl.2023.111605,SFX,37245390 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37245390]

Ensuring survival to children born (extremely) preterm is crucial. The incubator is a closed medical device, modifying the internal climate, and thus providing an environment for the child, as safe, warm, and comfortable as possible. While sound outside the incubator is managed and has decreased over the years, managing the noise inside the incubator is still a challenge. Method(s): Using active noise cancelling in an incubator will eliminate unwanted sounds (i.e., from the respirator and heating) inside the incubator, and by adding sophisticated algorithms, normal human speech, neonatal intensive care unit music-based therapeutic interventions, and natural sounds will be sustained for the child in the pod. Applying different methods such as active noise cancelling, motion capture, sonological engineering. and sophisticated machine learning algorithms will be implemented in the development of the incubator. Projected Results: A controlled and active sound environment in and around the incubator can in turn promote the wellbeing, neural development, and speech development of the child and minimise distress caused by unwanted noises. While developing the hardware and software pose individual challenges, it is about the system design and aspects contributing to it. On the one hand, it is crucial to measure the auditory range and frequencies in the incubator, as well as the predictable sounds that will have to be played back into the environment. On the other, there are many technical issues that have to be addressed when it comes to algorithms, datasets, delay, microphone technology, transducers, convergence, tracking, impulse control and noise rejection, noise mitigation stability, detection, polarity, and performance. Conclusion(s): Solving a complex problem like this, however, requires a de-disciplinary approach, where each discipline will realise its own shortcomings and boundaries, and in turn will allow for innovations and new avenues. Technical developments used for building the active noise cancellation-incubator have the potential to contribute to improved care solutions for patients, both infants and adults.

We used bibliometric methods to objectively analyzed the progress of presbycusis research over the past 20 years and to identify the research hotspots and emerging trends in this field. Method(s): Eligible literature metadata published between 2002 and 2021 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection on September 1, 2022. Bibliometric tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix R Package, Microsoft Excel 2019, and an online bibliometric platform were used to conduct bibliometric and visualized analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,693 publications related to presbycusis were retrieved. The number of publications increased continuously from 2002 to 2021, and the USA occupied the lead position in the field, with the highest research output. The most productive and influential institution, author, and journal were the University of California, Frisina DR of the University of South Florida, and Hearing Research, respectively. Co-citation cluster and trend topics analyses revealed that ""cochlear synaptopathy"", ""oxidative stress"", and ""dementia"" were the predominant foci of presbycusis research. Burst detection of keywords indicated that ""auditory cortex"" and ""Alzheimer's disease"" were the newly-emerged aspects. Conclusion(s): During the past two decades, presbycusis research has been flourishing. The current research foci are ""cochlear synaptopathy"", ""oxidative stress"", and ""dementia"". ""Auditory cortex"" and ""Alzheimer's disease"" may be potential future directions in this field. This bibliometric analysis represents the first quantitative overview of presbycusis research, thus providing valuable references and insights for scholars, medical practitioners, and policymakers concerned with this field.Copyright © 2023 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

(Colquitt, Li, Green, Veline, Brainard) Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States",eLife Sciences Publications Ltd,"Sensory feedback is required for the stable execution of learned motor skills, and its loss can severely disrupt motor performance. The neural mechanisms that mediate sensorimotor stability have been extensively studied at systems and physiological levels, yet relatively little is known about how disruptions to sensory input alter the molecular properties of associated motor systems. Songbird courtship song, a model for skilled behavior, is a learned and highly structured vocalization that is destabilized following deafening. Here, we sought to determine how the loss of auditory feedback modifies gene expression and its coordination across the birdsong senso-rimotor circuit. To facilitate this system-wide analysis of transcriptional responses, we developed a gene expression profiling approach that enables the construction of hundreds of spatially-defined RNA-sequencing libraries. Using this method, we found that deafening preferentially alters gene expression across birdsong neural circuitry relative to surrounding areas, particularly in premotor and striatal regions. Genes with altered expression are associated with synaptic transmission, neuronal spines, and neuromodulation and show a bias toward expression in glutamatergic neurons and Pvalb/Sst-class GABAergic interneurons. We also found that connected song regions exhibit correla-tions in gene expression that were reduced in deafened birds relative to hearing birds, suggesting that song destabilization alters the inter-region coordination of transcriptional states. Finally, lesioning LMAN, a forebrain afferent of RA required for deafening-induced song plasticity, had the largest effect on groups of genes that were also most affected by deafening. Combined, this integrated transcriptomics analysis demonstrates that the loss of peripheral sensory input drives a distributed gene expression response throughout associated sensorimotor neural circuitry and iden-tifies specific candidate molecular and cellular mechanisms that support the stability and plasticity of learned motor skills.Copyright © Colquitt et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.7554%2feLife.85970,SFX,37284822 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37284822]

While topics, such as comfortable housing, adequate social opportunities, stimulating enrichment, and a high standard of medical care, have continued to receive attention from managers and scientists, there is a lack of established acoustic consideration for monitoring the welfare of these animals. Marine mammals rely on sound production and reception for navigation and communication. Regulations governing anthropogenic sound production in our oceans have been put in place by many countries around the world, largely based on the results of research with managed and trained animals, due to the potential negative impacts that unrestricted noise can have on marine mammals. However, there has not been an established best practice for the acoustic welfare monitoring of marine mammals in professional care. By monitoring animal hearing and vocal behavior, a more holistic view of animal welfare can be achieved through the early detection of anthropogenic sound sources, the acoustic behavior of the animals, and even the features of the calls. In this review, the practice of monitoring cetacean acoustic welfare through behavioral hearing tests and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), passive acoustic monitoring, such as the Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System (WAMS), as well as ideas for using advanced technologies for utilizing vocal biomarkers of health are introduced and reviewed as opportunities for integration into marine mammal welfare plans.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3390%2fani13132124,SFX,

(Burton) Cochrane UK, Oxford, United Kingdom",John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"Background: Meniere's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. It is often treated with medication, but different interventions are sometimes used. Positive pressure therapy is a treatment that creates small pressure pulses, generated by a pump that is attached to tubing placed in the ear canal. It is typically used for a few minutes, several times per day. The underlying cause of Meniere's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear. Objective(s): To evaluate the benefits and harms of positive pressure therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with Meniere's disease. Search Method(s): The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022. Selection Criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Meniere's disease comparing positive pressure therapy with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months. Data Collection and Analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to <= 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main Result(s): We included three studies with a total of 238 participants, all of which compared positive pressure using the Meniett device to sham treatment. The duration of follow-up was a maximum of four months. Improvement in vertigo. A single study assessed whether participants had an improvement in the frequency of their vertigo whilst using positive pressure therapy, therefore we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the results. Change in vertigo. Only one study reported on the change in vertigo symptoms using a global score (at 3 to < 6 months), so we are again unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. All three studies reported on the change in the frequency of vertigo. The summary effect showed that people receiving positive pressure therapy had, on average, 0.84 fewer days per month affected by vertigo (95% confidence interval from 2.12 days fewer to 0.45 days more; 3 studies; 202 participants). However, the evidence on the change in vertigo frequency was of very low certainty, therefore there is great uncertainty in this estimate. Serious adverse events. None of the included studies provided information on the number of people who experienced serious adverse events. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or whether they were not assessed and reported. Authors' conclusions: The evidence for positive pressure therapy for Meniere's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare this intervention to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Meniere's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

(Jeng, Marcotti) School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, United Kingdom",SAGE Publications Ltd,"INTRODUCTION: Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), the most common health condition in older adults, is usually diagnosed only after patients start losing key hearing abilities, such as being able to distinguish speech in noisy environments. This is usually an indication that some irreversible damage has already happened to the sensory cells and neurons. Therefore, as we develop therapies to target ARHL, we also need to improve the diagnostic tools to detect the disease at an early stage. Here, we provide proof-of-principle, using mouse models, that machine learning (ML) techniques applied to non-invasive electrophysiological recordings of hearing function (auditory brainstem responses, ABRs) are well suited to detect early signs of ARHL. We used the common C57BL/6N mouse strain (6N), which suffers from early-onset ARHL due to an hypomorphic allele of Cadherin23 (Cdh23ahl). The ARHL phenotype becomes evident from around 3 months of age, when these mice develop a threshold shift in ABRs compared to a co-isogenic mouse strain in which the normal Cdh23 has been reinstated (6N-Repaired). METHOD(S): We recorded ABRs from a cohort of 1-month-old 6N and 6N-Repaired mice (104 mice). We trained ML algorithms through supervised learning using the ABR data as input features and the genotype as target. The hyperparameters of the models were optimised using random grid search and the performances were evaluated using repeated k-fold cross validation (10 repeats, k=5). APPROACH FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The statistical significance of the cross-validated scores was evaluated using permutation testing. Statistical analysis of experimental data was made using ANOVA followed by a suitable post hoc test. P<0.05 was selected as the criterion for statistical significance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Despite no shift in auditory thresholds at 1 month of age, several ML algorithms were successful in identifying the mice that had the Cdh23ahl allele (6N). Interestingly, feature importance analysis indicated that subtle differences in ABR waves I and V were employed by one of the models to discriminate between the two genotypes. Our strategy highlights the power of ML for the early diagnosis of ARHL and it could dramatically improve the success rate of future treatments.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641739631,SFX,

Nonetheless, some patients are able to compensate deficit using adaptive strategies. In this study, we explored the neural correlates underlying this adaptation. Twenty-one patients with UHL were separated into 3 groups using cluster analysis based on their binaural performance. The resulting clusters were referred to as better, moderate, and poorer performers cluster (BPC, MPC, and PPC). We measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited by deviant sounds located at 10, 20, and 100 from a standard positioned at 50 ipsilateral to the deaf ear. The BPC exhibited significant MMN for all 3 deviants, similar to normal hearing (NH) subjects. In contrast, there was no significant MMN for 10 and 20 deviants for the PPC and for NH when one ear was plugged and muffed. Scalp distribution was maximal over central regions in BPC, while PPC showed more frontal MMN distribution. Thus, the BPC exhibited a contralateral activation pattern, similar to NH, while the PPC exhibited more symmetrical hemispheric activation. MMN can be used as a neural marker to reflect spatial adaptation in patients with UHL.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press.

DESIGN: Hearing screening data were collected as part of two cluster randomized trials conducted in 15 communities in rural northwest Alaska. All children enrolled in school from preschool to 12th grade were eligible. Analysis was limited to data collected 2018 to 2019 (n = 1449), when both trials were running and measurement of high frequencies were included in the protocols. Analyses included estimates of diagnostic accuracy for each screening tool, as well as exploring performance by age and grade. Multiple imputation was used to assess diagnostic accuracy in younger children, where missing data were more prevalent due to requirements for conditioned responses. The audiometric reference standard included otoscopy, tympanometry, and high frequencies to ensure detection of infection-related and noise-induced hearing loss. RESULT(S): Both the mHealth pure-tone screen and DPOAE screen performed better when tympanometry was added to the protocol (increase in sensitivity of 19.9%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 15.9 to 24.1 for mHealth screen, 17.9%, 95% CI: 14.0 to 21.8 for high-frequency mHealth screen, and 10.4%, 95% CI: 7.5 to 13.9 for DPOAE). The addition of 6kHz to the mHealth pure-tone screen provided an 8.7 percentage point improvement in sensitivity (95% CI: 6.5 to 11.3). Completeness of data for both the reference standard and the mHealth screening tool differed substantially by age, due to difficulty with behavioral testing in young children. By age 7, children were able to complete behavioral testing, and data indicated that high-frequency mHealth pure-tone screen with tympanometry was the superior tool for children 7 years and older. For children 3 to 6 years of age, DPOAE plus tympanometry performed the best, both for complete data and multiply imputed data, which better approximates accuracy for children with missing data. CONCLUSION(S): This study directly evaluated pure-tone, DPOAE, and tympanometry tools as part of school hearing screening in rural Alaskan children (3 to 18+ years). Results from this study indicate that tympanometry is a key component in the hearing screening protocol, particularly in environments with higher prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. DPOAE is the preferred hearing screening tool when evaluating children younger than 7 years of age (below 2nd grade in the United States) due to the frequency of missing data with behavioral testing in this age group. For children 7 years and older, the addition of high frequencies to pure-tone screening increased the accuracy of screening, likely due to improved identification of hearing loss from noise exposure. The lack of a consistent reference standard in the literature makes comparing across studies challenging. In our study with a reference standard inclusive of otoscopy, tympanometry, and high frequencies, less than ideal sensitivities were found even for the most sensitive screening protocols, suggesting more investigation is necessary to ensure screening programs are appropriately identifying noise- and infection-related hearing loss in rural, low-resource settings.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Neely S.T.",,"(Merchant) Center for Hearing Research, Boys Town National Research Hospital, Omaha, NE, United States",NLM (Medline),"OBJECTIVES: Previous work has shown that wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) is sensitive to the volume of effusion present in ears with otitis media with effusion (OME). Prior work also demonstrates that the volume of the effusion appears to drive, or at least play a significant role in, how much conductive hearing loss (CHL) a child has due to a given episode of OME. Given this association, the goal of this work was to determine how well CHL could be estimated directly from WAI in ears with OME. DESIGN: Sixty-three ears from a previously published study on OME (ages 9 months to 11 years, 2 months) were grouped based on effusion volume (full, partial, or clear) determined during tympanostomy tube placement surgery and compared with age-matched normal control ears. Audiometric thresholds were obtained for a subset of the 34 ears distributed across the four groups. An electrical-analog model of ear-canal acoustics and middle-ear mechanics was fit to the measured WAI from individual ears. Initial estimates of CHL were derived from either (1) average absorbance or (2) the model component thought to represent damping in the ossicular chain. RESULT(S): The analog model produced good fits for all effusion-volume groups. The two initial CHL estimates were both well correlated (87% and 81%) with the pure-tone average hearing thresholds used to define the CHL. However, in roughly a third of the ears (11/34), the estimate based on damping was too large by nearly a factor of two. This observation motivated improved CHL estimates. CONCLUSION(S): Our CHL estimation method can estimate behavioral audiometric thresholds (CHL) within a margin of error that is small enough to be clinically meaningful. The importance of this finding is increased by the challenges associated with behavioral audiometric testing in pediatric populations, where OME is the most common. In addition, the discovery of two clusters in the damping-related CHL estimate suggests the possible existence of two distinctly different types of ears: pressure detectors and power detectors.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we investigated the prognostic factors for predicting the recovery in patients with ISSHL treated with combined treatment method using machine learning models. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 298 patients with ISSHL at a tertiary medical institution between January 2015 and September 2020. Fifty-two variables were analyzed to predict hearing recovery. Recovery was defined using Siegel's criteria, and the patients were categorized into recovery and non-recovery groups. Recovery was predicted by various machine learning models. In addition, the prognostic factors were analyzed using the difference in the loss function. Result(s): There were significant differences in variables including age, hypertension, previous hearing loss, ear fullness, duration of hospital admission, initial hearing level of the affected and unaffected ears, and post-treatment hearing level between recovery and non-recovery groups. The deep neural network model showed the highest predictive performance (accuracy, 88.81%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.9448). In addition, initial hearing level of affected and non-affected ear, post-treatment (2-weeks) hearing level of affected ear were significant factors for predicting the prognosis.

Neurosurgeons need to observe the lesion contour with the help of MRI images, which not only takes a lot of time, but also is easily affected by subjective factors. Therefore, the automatic and accurate segmentation of acoustic neuroma in cerebellopontine angle on MRI is of great significance for surgical treatment and expected rehabilitation. In this paper, an automatic segmentation method based on Transformer is proposed, using TransUNet as the core model. As some acoustic neuromas are irregular in shape and grow into the internal auditory canal, larger receptive fields are thus needed to synthesize the features. Therefore, we added Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to CNN, which can obtain a larger receptive field without losing too much resolution. Since acoustic neuromas often occur in the cerebellopontine angle area with relatively fixed position, we combined channel attention with pixel attention in the up-sampling stage so as to make our model automatically learn different weights by adding the attention mechanism. In addition, we collected 300 MRI sequence nuclear resonance images of patients with acoustic neuromas in Tianjin Huanhu hospital for training and verification. The ablation experimental results show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective. The comparative experimental results show that the Dice and Hausdorff 95 metrics of the proposed method reach 95.74% and 1.9476 mm respectively, indicating that it is not only superior to the classical models such as UNet, PANet, PSPNet, UNet++, and DeepLabv3, but also show better performance than the newly-proposed SOTA (state-of-the-art) models such as CCNet, MANet, BiseNetv2, Swin-Unet, MedT, TransUNet, and UCTransNet.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Zhang, Yang, Liu, Zheng, Bai and Ma.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2023.1207149,SFX,

Seventy-three possible NIHL susceptibility genes were input into the machine learning model. Two subgroups of NIHL could be distinguished by unsupervised machine learning and the classification was evaluated by the supervised machine learning algorithm. The VWF gene had the highest mutation frequency in the NIHL group and was expressed mainly in the spiral ligament.

To better understand the auditory processing deficits that underlie this problem, we made large-scale brain recordings from gerbils, a common animal model for human hearing, while presenting a large database of speech and noise sounds. We first used manifold learning to identify the neural subspace in which speech is encoded and found that it is low-dimensional and that the dynamics within it are profoundly distorted by hearing loss. We then trained a deep neural network (DNN) to replicate the neural coding of speech with and without hearing loss and analyzed the underlying network dynamics. We found that hearing loss primarily impacts spectral processing, creating nonlinear distortions in cross-frequency interactions that result in a hypersensitivity to background noise that persists even after amplification with a hearing aid. Our results identify a new focus for efforts to design improved hearing aids and demonstrate the power of DNNs as a tool for the study of central brain structures.Copyright © Sabesan et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.7554%2feLife.85108,SFX,37162188 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37162188]

Auditory outcomes improved despite low compliance among those receiving treatment. Medical chart data appeared more comprehensive for Veterans with, rather than without, auditory complaints. One possibility is that self-reported hearing problems are associated with a subset of these comorbidities, the treatment of which improved auditory outcomes. Purpose This study examined the relationships between Veterans' self-reported auditory problems and other diagnosed medical conditions. Research Design A retrospective chart review was used. Study Sample Participants were 286 Veterans, aged 21 - 52 with normal hearing. Veterans were dichotomized into a group with either self-reported hearing complaints (n = 143) or an aged-matched control group with no auditory complaints (n = 143). Data Collection and Analysis A query of the Computerized Patient Record System was performed with the date range restricted to 2009 to 2018. Metrics of self-perceived hearing handicap, APD testing, and hearing aid use were collected. All diagnoses and related symptoms were recorded. A best subsets regression with principled model selection was performed to investigate the role of these comorbidities on self-perceived hearing loss. Results The Self-Report group had 16 comorbidities that were classified as prevalent, having occurred in >=33.3% of the group, compared to the age-matched control group, which had 2 comorbidities. The number of diagnosed medical conditions was associated with self-perceived hearing impairment. Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related symptom clusters constituted the largest group of comorbidities that were significantly associated with self-reported hearing problems. Conclusions The significant association between PTSD and self-perceived hearing impairment warrants investigations on whether treatment of PTSD would reduce perceived hearing handicap severity. Further, PTSD assessments could be useful for audiologists to identify potential candidates for auditory complaints with normal audiometric thresholds.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Audiology.

However, no prospective, randomized controlled trial of hearing treatment for individuals with ARHL/LLD incorporating comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments and multimodal neuroimaging has been performed previously. Method(s): Double-blind randomized controlled trial of hearing aids for individuals aged >=60 years with a depressive disorder and at least moderate hearing loss (as defined by Pure Tone Average > 50dB). Participants are randomized to full-amplitude hearing aids or low-amplitude (i.e., sham) hearing aids for 12-weeks as an augmentation to antidepressant medications. Primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]), hearing status (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly [HHIE]), cognitive functioning (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [RBANS]), and social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale - Self Report [SAS-SR]), as well as connectivity/activation within the cognitive control network on a response inhibition/interference (Simon) task. Result(s): As the study is ongoing, data is reported for the combined sample (full- and low-amplitude groups) to preserve blinding. However, the between group analyses will be available for presentation at the AAGP Annual Meeting. Over the 12 weeks, significant improvements have been observed on HHIE and HRSD scores (-6.9, ES=0.7, p=0.01 and -7.0, ES=1.4, p=0.002; respectively), SAS-SR (+0.27, ES=0.7, p=0.003), immediate (+9.2, ES=0.6, p=0.005) and delayed memory (+4.4, ES=0.3, p=0.006). Behavioral data for N=13 participants completing the Simon task show significantly slower reaction times (RT, 772.3 vs. 701.6ms, p<0.001) and lower accuracy (92.7 vs. 95.8%, p=0.015) on incongruent vs. congruent trials. Significant task-related activations on this contrast are present in the basal ganglia, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus (voxelwise p<0.01, cluster size > 100). Conclusion(s): Combination therapy of hearing aids and antidepressant medications may result in improvement in depressive symptoms, cognition, and social functioning among individuals with ARHL and LLD.

This study was a retrospective cohort study. SSNHLV patients treated at our referral center from December 2016 to December 2020 were examined. The cohort comprised 64 patients with SSNHLV undergoing high-dose steroid treatment. MSWC was measured by calculating the wavelet coherence analysis (WCA) at various frequencies from a vHIT. The hearing prognosis were analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model and convolution neural network (CNN) of WCA. There were 64 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.67. The greater highest coherent frequency of the posterior semicircular canal (SCC) was associated with the complete recovery (CR) of hearing. After adjustment for other factors, the result remained robust (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86-2.35). In the feature extraction with Resnet-50 and proceeding SVM in the horizontal image cropping style, the classification accuracy [STD] for (CR vs. partial + no recovery [PR + NR]), (over-sampling of CR vs. PR + NR), (extensive data extraction of CR vs. PR + NR), and (interpolation of time series of CR vs. PR + NR) were 83.6% [7.4], 92.1% [6.8], 88.9% [7.5], and 91.6% [6.4], respectively. The high coherent frequency of the posterior SCC was a significantly independent factor that was associated with good hearing prognosis in the patients who have SSNHLV. WCA may be provided with comprehensive ability in vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) evaluation. CNN could be utilized to classify WCA, predict treatment outcomes, and facilitate vHIT interpretation. Feature extraction in CNN with proceeding SVM and horizontal cropping style of wavelet coherence plot performed better accuracy and offered more stable model for hearing outcomes in patients with SSNHLV than pure CNN classification. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement - High coherent frequency in vHIT results in good hearing outcomes in SSNHLV and facilitates AI classification.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1109%2fJTEHM.2023.3242339,SFX,36816096 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36816096]

Method(s): We recruited tinnitus patients with normal hearing or mild hearing loss (n = 17) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 20), and examined regional homogeneity and functional connectivity in resting-state brain activity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The present study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board on Experimental Ethics at Sun Yat-sen University, China (approval No. SYSEC-KY-KS-2019-083). Result(s): Compared with normal controls, patients with tinnitus had significantly decreased regional homogeneity in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and increased homogeneity in the inferior frontal gyrus (P < 0.05 corrected at a cluster-level). In addition, tinnitus patients showed enhanced functional connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and the ventral striatum and midbrain, as well as increased connectivity between the cerebellum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (P < 0.05 corrected at a cluster-level). We also found decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and the anterior insula compared with controls (P < 0.05 corrected at a cluster-level).

FFRs during high cortical arousal states also have a stronger relationship with speech perception. Aging is associated with increased auditory brain responses, which might reflect degraded inhibitory processing within the peripheral and ascending pathways, or changes in attentional control regulation via descending auditory pathways. Here, we tested the hypothesis that online corticofugal interplay is impacted by age-related hearing loss. Method(s): We measured EEG in older adults with normal-hearing (NH) and mild to moderate hearing-loss (HL) while they performed speech identification tasks in different noise backgrounds. We measured alpha power to index online cortical arousal states during task engagement. Subsequently, we split brainstem speech-FFRs, on a trial-by-trial basis, according to fluctuations in concomitant cortical alpha power into low or high alpha FFRs to index cortical-brainstem modulation. Result(s): We found cortical alpha power was smaller in the HL than the NH group. In NH listeners, alpha-FFRs modulation for clear speech (i.e., without noise) also resembled that previously observed in younger adults for speech in noise. Cortical-brainstem modulation was further diminished in HL older adults in the clear condition and by noise in NH older adults. Machine learning classification showed low alpha FFR frequency spectra yielded higher accuracy for classifying listeners' perceptual performance in both NH and HL participants. Moreover, low alpha FFRs decreased with increased hearing thresholds at 0.5-2 kHz for clear speech but noise generally reduced low alpha FFRs in the HL group. Discussion(s): Collectively, our study reveals cortical arousal state actively shapes brainstem speech representations and provides a potential new mechanism for older listeners' difficulties perceiving speech in cocktail party-like listening situations in the form of a miss-coordination between cortical and subcortical levels of auditory processing.Copyright © 2023 Lai, Alain and Bidelman.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2023.1075368,SFX,

This study investigated differences between cochlear implant users and normal-hearing peers in the clustering and time course of word retrieval during phonological and semantic verbal fluency tasks. METHOD(S): Twenty-eight children and adolescents (aged 9-17 years) with cochlear implants and 33 normal-hearing peers completed measures of verbal fluency, nonverbal intelligence, speech perception, and verbal short-term/working memory. Phonological and semantic verbal fluency tests were scored for total words generated, words generated in each 10-s interval of the 1-min task, latency to first word generated, number of word clusters, average cluster size, and number of word/cluster switches. RESULT(S): Children and adolescents with cochlear implants generated fewer words than normal-hearing peers throughout the entire 60-s time interval of the phonological and semantic fluency tasks. Cochlear implant users also had slower start latency times and produced fewer clusters and switches than normal-hearing peers during the phonological fluency task.

Kollmeier B.",,"(Hulsmeier, Kollmeier) Medizinische Physik and Cluster of Excellence Hearing4all, CvO Universitat, Oldenburg, Oldenburg 26111, Germany",Elsevier B.V.,"Plomp introduced an empirical separation of the increased speech recognition thresholds (SRT) in listeners with a sensorineural hearing loss into an Attenuation (A) component (which can be compensated by amplification) and a non-compensable Distortion (D) component. Previous own research backed up this notion by speech recognition models that derive their SRT prediction from the individual audiogram with or without a psychoacoustic measure of suprathreshold processing deficits. To determine the precision in separating the A and D component for the individual listener with various individual measures and individualized models, SRTs with 40 listeners with a variation in hearing impairment were obtained in quiet, stationary noise, and fluctuating noise (ICRA 5-250 and babble). Both the clinical audiogram and an adaptive, precise sweep audiogram were obtained as well as tone-in-noise detection thresholds at four frequencies to characterize the individual hearing impairment. For predicting the SRT, the FADE-model (which is based on machine learning) was used with either of the two audiogram procedures and optionally the individual tone-in-noise detection thresholds. The results indicate that the precisely measured swept tone audiogram allows for a more precise prediction of the individual SRT in comparison to the clinical audiogram (RMS error of 4.3 dB vs. 6.4 dB, respectively). While an estimation from the precise audiogram and FADE performed equally well in predicting the individual A and D component, the further refinement of including the tone-in-noise detection threshold with FADE led to a slight improvement of prediction accuracy (RMS error of 3.3 dB, 4.6 dB and 1.4 dB, for SRT, A and D component, respectively). Hence, applying FADE is advantageous for scientific purposes where a consistent modeling of different psychoacoustical effects in the same listener with a minimum amount of assumptions is desirable. For clinical purposes, however, a precisely measured audiogram and an estimation of the expected D component using a linear regression appears to be a satisfactory first step towards precision audiology.Copyright © 2022",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2022.108609,SFX,36209657 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36209657]

This study addressed the question to what degree supra-threshold auditory performance (i.e., temporal compression and frequency selectivity) as well as speech in noise (SiN) recognition are associated with neurostructural correlates in a sample of 59 healthy older adults with mild to moderate pure-tone hearing loss. Using surface-based morphometry on T1-weighted MRI images, CT, CV, and surface area (CSA) of several regions-of-interest were obtained. The results showed distinct neurostructural patterns for the different tasks in terms of involved regions as well as morphometric parameters. While pure-tone averages (PTAs) positively correlated with CT in a right hemisphere superior temporal sulcus and gyrus cluster, supra-threshold auditory perception additionally extended significantly to CV and CT in left and right superior temporal clusters including Heschl's gyrus and sulcus, the planum polare and temporale. For SiN recognition, we found significant correlations with an auditory-related CT cluster and furthermore with language-related areas in the prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results show that different auditory abilities are differently associated with cortical morphology in older adults with hearing impairment. Still, a common pattern is that greater PTAs and poorer supra-threshold auditory performance as well as poorer SiN recognition are all related to cortical thinning and volume loss but not to changes in CSA. These results support the hypothesis that mostly CT undergoes alterations in the context of auditory decline, while CSA remains stable.Copyright © 2023 University of Zurich and The Authors.

Established machine learning-based software could offer a rapid supportive tool to stratify patients with progressive hearing loss. A retrospective longitudinal analysis of 141 adult patients presenting with hearing loss was performed. Hearing threshold was measured at least twice 18 months or more apart. Based on the baseline audiogram, hearing thresholds and age were uploaded to AudioGene v4 (Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The University of Iowa City, IA, USA) to predict the underlying genetic cause of hearing loss and the likely progression of hearing loss. The progression of hearing loss was validated by comparison with the most recent audiogram data of the patients. The most frequently predicted loci were DFNA2B, DFNA9 and DFNA2A. The frequency of loci/genes predicted by AudioGene remains consistent when using the initial or the final audiogram of the patients. In conclusion, machine learning-based software analysis of clinical data might be a useful tool to identify patients at risk for having autosomal dominant hearing loss. With this approach, patients with suspected progressive hearing loss could be subjected to close audiological followup, genetic testing and improved patient counselling. rcial use only.Copyright © the Author(s), 2019.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.4081%2faudiores.2019.230,SFX,

The objectives were to assess whether HEAR-QL score was inversely correlated with hearing loss and middle ear disease in an Alaska Native population. Method(s): The HEAR-QL questionnaires for children and adolescents were administered as part of a cluster randomized trial in rural Alaska from 2017 to 2019. Enrolled students completed an audiometric evaluation and HEAR-QL questionnaire on the same day. A cross-sectional evaluation of questionnaire data was utilized. Result(s): A total of 733 children (ages 7-12 years) and 440 adolescents (ages >=13 years) completed the questionnaire. Median HEAR-QL scores were similar among children with and without hearing loss (Kruskal-Wallis, p =.39); however, adolescent HEAR-QL scores significantly decreased with increasing hearing loss (p <.001). Median HEAR-QL scores were significantly lower in both children (p =.02) and adolescents (p <.001) with middle ear disease compared with those without. In both children and adolescents, the addendum scores were strongly correlated with total HEAR-QL score (rhoSpearman = 0.72 and 0.69, respectively). Conclusion(s): The expected negative association between hearing loss and HEAR-QL score was observed in adolescents. However, there was significant variability that could not be explained by hearing loss, and further investigation is warranted. The expected negative association was not observed in children. HEAR-QL scores were associated with middle ear disease in both children and adolescents, making it potentially valuable in populations where the prevalence of ear infections is high.

ANSD represents up to 15% of individuals with hearing impairments. Through mutation screening, bioinformatic analysis and expression studies, we have previously identified several apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) mitochondria-associated 1 (AIFM1) variants in ANSD families and in some other sporadic cases. Here, to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying each AIFM1 variant, we generated AIF-null cells using the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and constructed AIF-wild type (WT) and AIF-mutant (mut) (p.T260A, p.R422W, and p.R451Q) stable transfection cell lines. We then analyzed AIF structure, coenzyme-binding affinity, apoptosis, and other aspects. Results revealed that these variants resulted in impaired dimerization, compromising AIF function. The reduction reaction of AIF variants had proceeded slower than that of AIF-WT. The average levels of AIF dimerization in AIF variant cells were only 34.5%-49.7% of that of AIF-WT cells, resulting in caspase-independent apoptosis. The average percentage of apoptotic cells in the variants was 12.3%-17.9%, which was significantly higher than that (6.9%-7.4%) in controls. However, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) treatment promoted the reduction of apoptosis by rescuing AIF dimerization in AIF variant cells. Our findings show that the impairment of AIF dimerization by AIFM1 variants causes apoptosis contributing to ANSD, and introduce NADH as a potential drug for ANSD treatment. Our results help elucidate the mechanisms of ANSD and may lead to the provision of novel therapies.Copyright © 2023, Zhejiang University Press.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1631%2fjzus.B2200081,SFX,36751702 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36751702]

Poor soundscapes have been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). We evaluated the effect of the Mobile Soundscape Appraisal and Recording Technology sound awareness intervention (MoSART+) on NPS in nursing home residents with dementia. Design(s): A 15-month, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial. Every 3 months, a nursing home switched from care as usual to the use of the intervention. Intervention(s): The 3-month MoSART+ intervention involved ambassador training, staff performing sound measurements with the MoSART application, meetings, and implementation of microinterventions. The goal was to raise awareness about soundscapes and their influence on residents. Setting and participants: We included 110 residents with dementia in 5 Dutch nursing homes. Exclusion criteria were palliative sedation and deafness. Method(s): The primary outcome was NPS severity measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) by the resident's primary nurse. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (QUALIDEM), psychotropic drug use (ATC), staff workload (workload questionnaire), and staff job satisfaction (Maastricht Questionnaire of Job Satisfaction). Result(s): The mean age of the residents (n = 97) at enrollment was 86.5 +/- 6.7 years, and 76 were female (76.8%). The mean NPI-NH score was 17.5 +/- 17.3. One nursing home did not implement the intervention because of staff shortages. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a clinically relevant reduction in NPS between the study groups (-8.0, 95% CI -11.7, -2.6). There was no clear effect on quality of life [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI -0.7, 6.3], psychotropic drug use (1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.7), staff workload (-0.3, 95% CI -0.3, 0.8), or staff job satisfaction (-0.2, 95% CI -1.2, 0.7). Conclusions and Implications: MoSART+ empowered staff to adapt the local soundscape, and the intervention effectively reduced staff-reported levels of NPS in nursing home residents with dementia. Nursing homes should consider implementing interventions to improve the soundscape.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.jamda.2022.11.010,SFX,36528077 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36528077]

The hearing results, however, considerably vary across patients. This may partly be due to variability in the CI fitting. We investigated the effect of FOX, a software tool to program CIs using artificial intelligence (AI), on hearing outcomes. METHOD(S): Forty-seven experienced CI patients who came to our tertiary CI center for their annual follow-up between 2017 and 2020 were recruited for this study. They received a new CI map created by the AI software tool. CI parameters and auditory outcomes obtained with this new map were compared with those of the initial manual map after 15 days of take-home experience. Within-patient differences were assessed. At the end of the study, the patients were offered a choice to continue using the AI map or to revert to their old manual map. RESULT(S): Several auditory outcomes improved with the AI map, namely, pure tone audiometric threshold at 6,000 Hz (median improvement 10 dB, range = -20 to 50 dB, Z = -2.608, p = 0.008), phonemic discrimination scores (median improvement 10%, range = 0% to 30%, Z = -4.061, p = 0.001), and soft-intensity (median improvement of 10%, range = -20% to 90%, Z = -4.412, p < 0.001) to normal-intensity (median improvement of 10%, range = -30% to 60%, Z = -3.35, p < 0.001) speech audiometric scores.

In the past, many people did not understand its application mechanism and role and only focused on non-syndromic deafness, so the research on syndromic deafness is not in-depth and there is a large degree of lack of research in this area. In order to let the public know more about the diagnosis and gene function of deafness caused by PTPN11 gene mutation syndrome, this paper used deep learning technology to study the diagnosis and gene function of deafness caused by syndrome with the concept of intelligent medical treatment, and finally drew a feasible conclusion. This paper provided a theoretical and practical basis for the diagnosis of deafness caused by PTPN11 gene mutation syndrome and the study of gene function. This paper made a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 85 deaf children who visited Hunan Children's Hospital,P.R. China from January 2020 to December 2021. The conclusion were as follows: Children aged 1-6 years old had multiple syndrome deafness, while children under 1 year old and children aged 6-12 years old had relatively low probability of complex deafness; girls were not easy to have comprehensive deafness, but there was no specific basis to prove that the occurrence of comprehensive deafness was necessarily related to gender; the hearing loss of patients with Noonan Syndrome was mainly characterized by moderate and severe damage and abnormal inner ear and auditory nerve; most of the mutation genes in children were located in Exon1 and Exon3, with a total probability of 57.65%. In the course of the experiment, it was found that deep learning was effective in the diagnosis of deafness with PTPN11 gene mutation syndrome. This technology could be applied to medical diagnosis to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of more patients with deafness with syndrome. Intelligent medical treatment was also becoming a hot topic nowadays. By using this concept to analyze and study the pathological characteristics of deafness caused by PTPN11 gene mutation syndrome, it not only promoted patients to find diseases in time, but also helped doctors to diagnose and treat such diseases, which was of great significance to patients and doctors. The study of PTPN11 gene mutation syndrome deafness was also of great significance in genetics. The analysis of its genes not only enriched the gene pool, but also provided reference for future research.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Huang, Huang, Zhao, Xie, Liu and Chang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3389%2ffgene.2023.1113095,SFX,

Lack of standardized screening, awareness, cost, and access to hearing testing present barriers to HL identification. To facilitate prescreening and selection of patients who warrant audiometric evaluation, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict speech-frequency pure-tone average (PTA). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHOD(S): The cohort included 8918 adults (>=20 years) who completed audiometric testing with NHANES (2012-2018). The primary outcome measure was the prediction of better hearing ear speech-frequency PTA. Relevant predictors included demographics, medical conditions, and subjective assessment of hearing. Supervised ML with a tree-based architecture was used. Regression performance was determined by the mean absolute error (MAE) with binary classification assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULT(S): Using the full set of predictors, the test set MAE between the ML-predicted and actual PTA was 5.29dB HL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.97-5.61). The 5 most influential predictors of higher PTA were increased age, worse subjective hearing, male gender, increased body mass index, and history of smoking. The 5-factor abbreviated model performed comparably to the extended feature set with MAE 5.36 (95% CI: 5.03-5.69) and AUC for PTA>25dB HL of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94). CONCLUSION(S): The ML model was able to predict PTA with patient demographics, clinical factors, and subjective hearing status.

The questions surrounding how pitch is represented in the auditory system, and how our percept relates to the underlying acoustic waveform, have been a topic of inquiry and debate for well over a century. New findings and technological innovations have led to challenges of some long-standing assumptions and have raised new questions. This article reviews some recent developments in the study of pitch coding and perception and focuses on the topic of how pitch information is extracted from peripheral representations based on frequency-to-place mapping (tonotopy), stimulus-driven auditory-nerve spike timing (phase locking), or a combination of both. Although a definitive resolution has proved elusive, the answers to these questions have potentially important implications for mitigating the effects of hearing loss via devices such as cochlear implants.Copyright © 2023 Oxenham.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.1074752,SFX,

Mouse models offer a possibility to elucidate genes involved in the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms of hearing impairment. To this end, large-scale mouse phenotyping programs include auditory phenotyping of single-gene knockout mouse lines. Using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) procedure, the German Mouse Clinic and similar facilities worldwide have produced large, uniform data sets of averaged ABR raw data of mutant and wildtype mice. In the course of standard ABR analysis, hearing thresholds are assessed visually by trained staff from series of signal curves of increasing sound pressure level. This is time-consuming and prone to be biased by the reader as well as the graphical display quality and scale.In an attempt to reduce workload and improve quality and reproducibility, we developed and compared two methods for automated hearing threshold identification from averaged ABR raw data: a supervised approach involving two combined neural networks trained on human-generated labels and a self-supervised approach, which exploits the signal power spectrum and combines random forest sound level estimation with a piece-wise curve fitting algorithm for threshold finding.We show that both models work well and are suitable for fast, reliable, and unbiased hearing threshold detection and quality control. In a high-throughput mouse phenotyping environment, both methods perform well as part of an automated end-to-end screening pipeline to detect candidate genes for hearing involvement.

(Fullgrabe) School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom",Frontiers Media S.A.,"Hearing-aid (HA) prescription rules (such as NAL-NL2, DSL-v5, and CAM2) are used by HA audiologists to define initial HA settings (e.g., insertion gains, IGs) for patients. This initial fitting is later individually adjusted for each patient to improve clinical outcomes in terms of speech intelligibility and listening comfort. During this fine-tuning stage, speech-intelligibility tests are often carried out with the patient to assess the benefits associated with different HA settings. As these tests tend to be time-consuming and performance on them depends on the patient's level of fatigue and familiarity with the test material, only a limited number of HA settings can be explored. Consequently, it is likely that a suboptimal fitting is used for the patient. Recent studies have shown that automatic speech recognition (ASR) can be used to predict the effects of IGs on speech intelligibility for patients with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). The aim of the present study was to extend this approach by optimizing, in addition to IGs, compression thresholds (CTs). However, increasing the number of parameters to be fitted increases exponentially the number of configurations to be assessed. To limit the number of HA settings to be tested, three random-search (RS) genetic algorithms were used. The resulting new HA fitting method, combining ASR and RS, is referred to as ""objective prescription rule based on ASR and random search"" (OPRA-RS). Optimal HA settings were computed for 12 audiograms, representing average and individual audiometric profiles typical for various levels of ARHL severity, and associated ASR performances were compared to those obtained with the settings recommended by CAM2. Each RS algorithm was run twice to assess its reliability. For all RS algorithms, ASR scores obtained with OPRA-RS were significantly higher than those associated with CAM2. Each RS algorithm converged on similar optimal HA settings across repetitions. However, significant differences were observed between RS algorithms in terms of maximum ASR performance and processing costs.

Previously, SR waveforms have been ignored, or assessed with basic statistical techniques and/or simple template matching paradigms. This has led to considerable variability in SR studies from different laboratories, and species. In an effort to standardize SR assessment methods, we developed a machine learning algorithm and workflow to automatically classify SR waveforms in virtually any animal model including mice, rats, guinea pigs, and gerbils obtained with various paradigms and modalities from several laboratories. The universal features common to SR waveforms of various species and paradigms are examined and discussed in the context of each animal model. The procedure describes common results using the SR across species and how to fully implement the open-source R implementation. Since SR is widely used to investigate toxicological or pharmaceutical efficacy, a detailed and universal SR waveform classification protocol should be developed to aid in standardizing SR assessment procedures across different laboratories and species. This machine learning-based method will improve data reliability and translatability between labs that use the startle reflex paradigm.Copyright © 2022",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2022.108667,SFX,36566642 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36566642]

Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-three patients with ISSNHL were admitted from September 2014 to November 2020. The clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. Prognostic factors for ISSNHL were assessed based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and used to create a nomogram. Nomogram performance in terms of predictive and discriminatory ability was evaluated by calculating the concordance index (C-index) and generating calibration plots. Result(s): The overall hearing improvement rate was 41.4%, comprising complete recovery (13.3%), marked recovery (17.0%), and slight recovery (11.1%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, symptoms of vertigo, interval between onset and treatment, low-density lipoprotein, and type of hearing loss were independent predictors of ISSNHL. A nomogram based on these 5 factors had a C index of 0.798 (95% confidence interval 0.750-0.845). Conclusion(s): Age, vertigo, interval between onset and treatment, low-density lipoprotein level, and type of hearing loss are closely associated with hearing recovery.

This study sought to quantify relationships between infection-mediated hearing loss and middle ear disease and environmental factors, such as exposure to wood smoke, cigarette smoke, household crowding, and lack of access to plumbed (running) water, in a northwest region of rural Alaska. DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional analysis to estimate environmental factors of infection-related hearing loss in children aged 3 to 21 years. School hearing screenings were performed as part of two cluster randomized trials in rural Alaska over two academic years (2017-2018 and 2018-2019). The first available screening for each child was used for this analysis. Sociodemographic questionnaires were completed by parents/guardians upon entry into the study. Multivariable regression was performed to estimate prevalence differences and prevalence ratios (PR). A priori knowledge about the prevalence of middle ear disease and the difficulty inherent in obtaining objective hearing loss data in younger children led to analysis of children by age (3 to 6 years versus 7 years and older) and a separate multiple imputation sensitivity analysis for pure-tone average (PTA)-based infection-related hearing loss measures. RESULT(S): A total of 1634 children participated. Hearing loss was present in 11.1% of children sampled based on otoacoustic emission as the primary indicator of hearing loss and was not associated with exposure to cigarette smoke (PR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 2.38), use of a wood-burning stove (PR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.32), number of persons living in the household (PR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.16), or lack of access to running water (PR = 1.38; 95% CI, 0.80 to 2.39). Using PTA as a secondary indicator of hearing loss also showed no association with environmental factors. Middle ear disease was present in 17.4% of children. There was a higher prevalence of middle ear disease in homes without running water versus those with access to running water (PR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.27). There was little evidence to support any cumulative effects of environmental factors. Heterogeneity of effect models by age found sample prevalence of hearing loss higher for children aged 3 to 6 years (12.2%; 95% CI, 9.3 to 15.7) compared to children 7 years and older (10.6%; 95% CI, 8.9 to 2.6), as well as for sample prevalence of middle ear disease (22.7%; 95% CI, 18.9 to 26.9 and 15.3%; 95% CI, 13.3 to 17.5, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Lack of access to running water in the home was associated with increased prevalence of middle ear disease in this rural, Alaska Native population, particularly among younger children (aged 3 to 6 years). There was little evidence in this study that cigarette smoke, wood-burning stoves, and greater numbers of persons in the household were associated with infection-mediated hearing loss or middle ear disease. Future research with larger sample sizes and more sensitive measures of environmental exposure is necessary to further evaluate these relationships. Children who live in homes without access to running water may benefit from earlier and more frequent hearing health visits.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Method(s): In May 2021, 3516 workers in an automobile manufacturing enterprise were investigated by using a self-made questionnaireNoise Workers Questionnaire and cluster sampling method. The occupational noise hygiene survey and occupational hazards detection were carried out in their workplaces. They were divided into noise exposure group and non-noise exposure group according to whether they were exposed to noise or not. The general characteristics, hearing and nervous system symptoms of the two groups of workers were compared, and the risk of hearing loss was assessed. Result(s): There were 758 workers in the noise exposure group, aged (26+/-5) years old, with a working age of 3.0 (2.0, 6.0) years exposed to noise. 2758 workers in the non-noise exposure group, aged (25+/-6) years old, with a working age of 2.0 (1.0, 4.0) years. There were statistically significant differences in the distribution of workers'education level, working age and memory loss between the two groups (chi(2)=37.98, 38.70, 5.20, P<0.05). The workers in the noise exposure group showed a decreasing trend of insomnia, dreaminess, sweating and fatigue with the increase of working age (chi(2trend)=6.16, 7.99, P<0.05). The risk classification of binaural high-frequency hearing loss for workers in all noise positions until the age of 50 and 60 was negligible, the risk of occupational noise deafness was low for workers in stamping and welding noise positions until the age of 60.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that is based on event-related potentials (ERPs), could provide objective speech discrimination. In this work we proposed a visual-ERP-based method to assess speech discrimination using pictures that represent word meaning. The proposed method was implemented with three strategies, each with different number of pictures and test sequences. Machine learning was adopted to classify between the task conditions based on features that were extracted from EEG signals. The results from the proposed method were compared to that of a similar visual-ERP-based method using letters and a method that is based on the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) component. The P3 component and the late positive potential (LPP) component were observed in the two visual-ERP-based methods while MMN was observed during the MMN-based method. A total of two out of three strategies of the proposed method, along with the MMN-based method, achieved approximately 80% average classification accuracy by a combination of support vector machine (SVM) and common spatial pattern (CSP).

This study aimed to investigate the topological features of the brain functional network and structural dysfunction of the central nervous system in ARHL using graph theory. Method(s): Forty-six patients with ARHL and forty-five age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls were recruited to undergo a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan in this study. Graph theory was applied to analyze the topological properties of the functional connectomes by studying the local and global organization of neural networks. Result(s): Compared with healthy controls, the patient group showed increased local efficiency (Eloc) and clustering coefficient (Cp) of the small-world network. Besides, the degree centrality (Dc) and nodal efficiency (Ne) values of the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) in the patient group showed a decrease in contrast with the healthy control group. In addition, the intra-modular interaction of the occipital lobe module and the inter-modular interaction of the parietal occipital module decreased in the patient group, which was positively correlated with Dc and Ne. The intra-modular interaction of the occipital lobe module decreased in the patient group, which was negatively correlated with the Eloc. Conclusion(s): Based on fMRI and graph theory, we indicate the aberrant small-world network topology in ARHL and dysfunctional interaction of the occipital lobe and parietal lobe, emphasizing the importance of dysfunctional left IOG.

Nonhuman studies have repeatedly highlighted cross-modal brain plasticity in sensorial brain networks other than those primarily involved in the peripheral damage, thus in this study, the possible cortical alterations associated with HL have been analyzed using a whole-brain multimodal connectomic approach. Fifty-two HL and 30 normal hearing participants were examined in a 3T MRI study along with audiological and neurological assessments. Between-regions functional connectivity and whole-brain probabilistic tractography were calculated in a connectome-based manner and graph theory was used to obtain low-dimensional features for the analysis of brain connectivity at global and local levels. The HL condition was associated with a different functional organization of the visual subnetwork as revealed by a significant increase in global efficiency, density, and clustering coefficient. These functional effects were mirrored by similar (but more subtle) structural effects suggesting that a functional repurposing of visual cortical centers occurs to compensate for age-related loss of hearing abilities.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.neurobiolaging.2021.09.024,SFX,34915240 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34915240]

Method(s): A semi-qualitative cross-sectional study was used which entailed analysing miners' personal health records from 2014 to 2018. Data were accessed from the audiometry medical surveillance database (n = 480), the hearing screening database (n = 24,321), and the occupational hygiene database (n = 15,769). Ethical principles were applied to demonstrate big data protection and sharing. Result(s): Some audiometry screening and occupational hygiene records were incomplete and/or inaccurate (N = 4675). The database containing medical disease and treatment records could not be accessed. Ethical challenges included a lack of clarity regarding permission rights when sharing big data, and no policy governing the divulgence of miners' personal and medical records for research. Conclusion(s): This case study illustrates how research can be effectively, although not maliciously, obstructed by the strict protection of employee medical data. Clearly communicated company policies should be developed for the sharing of workers' records in the mining industry to improve HCPs.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Normal-hearing listeners accomplish this task with relative ease by segregating the scene into its constituent sound sources, then selecting and attending to a target source. An assistive listening device that mimics the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior may provide an effective solution for those with difficulty listening in acoustically cluttered environments (e.g., a cocktail party). Here, we present a binaural sound segregation algorithm based on a hierarchical network model of the auditory system. In the algorithm, binaural sound inputs first drive populations of neurons tuned to specific spatial locations and frequencies. The spiking response of neurons in the output layer are then reconstructed into audible waveforms via a novel reconstruction method. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm with a speech-on-speech intelligibility task in normal-hearing listeners. This two-microphone-input algorithm is shown to provide listeners with perceptual benefit similar to that of a 16-microphone acoustic beamformer. These results demonstrate the promise of this biologically inspired algorithm for enhancing selective listening in challenging multi-talker scenes.Copyright © 2022 Chou, Boyd, Best, Colburn and Sen.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.1004071,SFX,

It gradually degenerates from embryonic columnar cells to cuboidal cells in the internal sulcus at postnatal day 12 (P12)-P14, with the cochlea maturing when the degeneration of supporting cells in the Kolliker's organ is complete, which is distinct from humans because it disappears at birth already. The supporting cells in the Kolliker's organ play a key role during this critical period of auditory development. Spontaneous release of ATP induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in inner hair cells in a paracrine form via intercellular gap junction protein hemichannels. The Ca2+ further induces the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic vesicles of the inner hair cells, which subsequently excite afferent nerve fibers. In this way, the supporting cells in the Kolliker's organ transmit temporal and spatial information relevant to cochlear development to the hair cells, promoting fine-tuned connections at the synapses in the auditory pathway, thus facilitating cochlear maturation and auditory acquisition. The Kolliker's organ plays a crucial role in such a scenario. In this article, we review the morphological changes, biological functions, degeneration, possible trans-differentiation of cochlear hair cells, and potential molecular mechanisms of supporting cells in the Kolliker's organ during the auditory development in mammals, as well as future research perspectives.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Gao, Sun and Yang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnmol.2022.1031989,SFX,

Here, we investigated if degeneration of the olivocochlear (OC) efferent innervation is also a major aspect of the synaptopathic ear, by quantifying the volume and spatial organization of its cholinergic and dopaminergic components, using antibodies to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), respectively. CBA/CaJ male mice were examined 1 day to 8 months after a synaptopathic noise exposure, and compared to unexposed age-matched controls and unexposed aged mice at 24-28 months. In normal ears, cholinergic lateral (L)OC terminals were denser in the apical half of the cochlea and on the modiolar side of the inner hair cells (IHCs), where ANFs of low-spontaneous rate are typically found, while dopaminergic terminals were more common in the basal third of the cochlea and, re the IHC axes, were offset towards the habenula with respect to cholinergic terminals. The noise had only small and transient effects on the density of LOC innervation, its spatial organization around the IHC axes, or the extent to which TH and VAT signal were colocalized. The synaptopathic noise also had relatively small and transient effects on cholinergic innervation density in the outer hair cell (OHC) area, which normally peaks in the 16 kHz region and falls monotonically towards higher and lower frequencies. In contrast, in the aged ears, there was massive degeneration of OHC efferents, especially in the apical half of the cochlea, where there was also significant loss of OHCs. In the IHC area, there was significant loss of cholinergic terminals in both apical and basal regions and of dopaminergic innervation in the basal half. Furthermore, the cholinergic terminals in the aged ears spread from their normal clustering near the IHC basolateral pole, where the ANF synapses are found, to positions up and down the IHC somata and regions of the neuropil closer to the habenula. This apparent migration was most striking in the apex, where the hair cell pathology was greatest, and may be a harbinger of impending hair cell death.Copyright © 2022",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2022.108533,SFX,35671600 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=35671600]

However, in the context of stochastic resonance, noise has been shown to improve signal detection of weak sub- threshold signals, and it has been proposed that the brain might actively exploit this phenomenon. Especially within the auditory system, recent studies suggest that intrinsic noise plays a key role in signal processing and might even correspond to increased spontaneous neuronal firing rates observed in early processing stages of the auditory brain stem and cortex after hearing loss. Here we present a computational model of the auditory pathway based on a deep neural network, trained on speech recognition. We simulate different levels of hearing loss and investigate the effect of intrinsic noise. Remarkably, speech recognition after hearing loss actually improves with additional intrinsic noise. This surprising result indicates that intrinsic noise might not only play a crucial role in human auditory processing, but might even be beneficial for contemporary machine learning approaches.Copyright © 2022 Schilling, Gerum, Metzner, Maier and Krauss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.908330,SFX,

This study aimed to identify the topological reorganization of brain functional network in presbycusis with/without cognitive decline by using graph theory analysis approaches based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Method(s): Resting-state fMRI scans were obtained from 30 presbycusis patients with cognitive decline, 30 presbycusis patients without cognitive decline, and 50 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls. Graph theory was applied to analyze the topological properties of brain functional networks including global and nodal metrics, modularity, and rich-club organization. Result(s): At the global level, the brain functional networks of all participants were found to possess small-world properties. Also, significant group differences in global network metrics were observed among the three groups such as clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, normalized characteristic path length, and small-worldness. At the nodal level, several nodes with abnormal betweenness centrality, degree centrality, nodal efficiency, and nodal local efficiency were detected in presbycusis patients with/without cognitive decline. Changes in intra-modular connections in frontal lobe module and inter-modular connections in prefrontal subcortical lobe module were found in presbycusis patients exposed to modularity analysis. Rich-club nodes were reorganized in presbycusis patients, while the connections among them had no significant group differences. Conclusion(s): Presbycusis patients exhibited topological reorganization of the whole-brain functional network, and presbycusis patients with cognitive decline showed more obvious changes in these topological properties than those without cognitive decline. Abnormal changes of these properties in presbycusis patients may compensate for cognitive impairment by mobilizing additional neural resources.Copyright © 2022 Guan, Xu, Chen, Xing, Xu, Shang, Xu, Wu and Yan.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnagi.2022.905487,SFX,

It is associated with neurophysiological alterations in the central nervous system and chronic stress, which can be related with a disinhibition of the inflammatory system. We here investigated the association between resting-state oscillatory activity assessed with Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and peripheral inflammation assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP) in a group of patients with chronic tinnitus (N = 21, nine males, mean age: 40.6 +/- 14.6 years). Additionally, CRP was assessed in an age- and sex-matched healthy control group (N = 21, nine males, mean age: 40.9 +/- 15.2 years). No MEG data was available for the control group. We found a significant negative correlation between CRP and gamma power in the orbitofrontal cortex in tinnitus patients (p < 0.001), pointing to a deactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex when CRP was high. No significant clusters were found for other frequency bands. Moreover, CRP levels were significantly higher in the tinnitus group than in the healthy controls (p = 0.045). Our results can be interpreted based on findings from previous studies having disclosed the orbitofrontal cortex as part of the tinnitus distress network. We suggest that higher CRP levels and the associated deactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex in chronic tinnitus patients is maintaining the tinnitus percept through disinhibition of the auditory cortex and attentional or emotional top-down processes. Although the direction of the association (i.e., causation) between CRP levels and orbitofrontal gamma power in chronic tinnitus is not yet known, inflammation reducing interventions are promising candidates when developing treatments for tinnitus patients.

(Kollmeier) Hearing Speech and Audio Technology, Fraunhofer Institute of Digital Media Technology, IDMT, Oldenburg, Germany",Frontiers Media S.A.,"For characterizing the complexity of hearing deficits, it is important to consider different aspects of auditory functioning in addition to the audiogram. For this purpose, extensive test batteries have been developed aiming to cover all relevant aspects as defined by experts or model assumptions. However, as the assessment time of physicians is limited, such test batteries are often not used in clinical practice. Instead, fewer measures are used, which vary across clinics. This study aimed at proposing a flexible data-driven approach for characterizing distinct patient groups (patient stratification into auditory profiles) based on one prototypical database (N = 595) containing audiogram data, loudness scaling, speech tests, and anamnesis questions. To further maintain the applicability of the auditory profiles in clinical routine, we built random forest classification models based on a reduced set of audiological measures which are often available in clinics. Different parameterizations regarding binarization strategy, cross-validation procedure, and evaluation metric were compared to determine the optimum classification model. Our data-driven approach, involving model-based clustering, resulted in a set of 13 patient groups, which serve as auditory profiles. The 13 auditory profiles separate patients within certain ranges across audiological measures and are audiologically plausible. Both a normal hearing profile and profiles with varying extents of hearing impairments are defined. Further, a random forest classification model with a combination of a one-vs.-all and one-vs.-one binarization strategy, 10-fold cross-validation, and the kappa evaluation metric was determined as the optimal model. With the selected model, patients can be classified into 12 of the 13 auditory profiles with adequate precision (mean across profiles = 0.9) and sensitivity (mean across profiles = 0.84). The proposed approach, consequently, allows generating of audiologically plausible and interpretable, data-driven clinical auditory profiles, providing an efficient way of characterizing hearing deficits, while maintaining clinical applicability. The method should by design be applicable to all audiological data sets from clinics or research, and in addition be flexible to summarize information across databases by means of profiles, as well as to expand the approach toward aided measurements, fitting parameters, and further information from databases.Copyright © 2022 Saak, Huelsmeier, Kollmeier and Buhl.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2022.959582,SFX,

SGS is associated with de novo pathogenic variants in the SETBP1 gene. In specific, SETBP1 variants in over 50 patients with classical or non-classical SGS were clustered within exon 4. A male Chinese neonate with dysmorphic facial features, nervous system disorders, and organ malformations at birth was examined in this study and long-term followed-up. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify any underlying pathogenic variants in the proband. Additionally, we reviewed the literature that documents the main clinical features and underlying variants of all patients genetically diagnosed with SGS. The neonate had a characteristic midface retraction, abnormal electroencephalogram waveforms, and genital abnormalities. The patient did not initially develop hydronephrosis or undergo a comprehensive skeletal assessment. Six months after birth, the patient had an epileptic seizure and experienced persistent neurodevelopmental delay with auditory and visual abnormalities. Color Doppler ultrasonography at 18 months revealed hydronephrosis and bilateral widening of the lateral ventricles. The patient died suddenly 20.5 months after birth. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo variant (c.2605A > G:p.S869G) in exon 4 degradation sequence in SETBP1. The reported de novo heterozygous variant in SETBP1 (c.2605A > G:p.S869G) broadens the knowledge of the scientific community's on the possible SGS genetic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SETBP1 variant (c.2605A > G:p.S869G) in SGS. The clinical manifestations of neonatal SGS are atypical, and genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis. Long-term follow-up should be conducted after diagnosis to optimize the therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Liu, Chen, Lin, Wang, Chen, Wang and Yan.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffped.2022.920741,SFX,

In patients with cochlear implant (CI), the technique is increasingly used to monitor residual inner ear function. So far, when analyzing ECochG potentials, the visual assessment has been the gold standard. However, visual assessment requires a high level of experience to interpret the signals. Furthermore, expert-dependent assessment leads to inconsistency and a lack of reproducibility. The aim of this study was to automate and objectify the analysis of cochlear microphonic (CM) signals in ECochG recordings. Method(s): Prospective cohort study including 41 implanted ears with residual hearing. We measured ECochG potentials at four different electrodes and only at stable electrode positions (after full insertion or postoperatively). When stimulating acoustically, depending on the individual residual hearing, we used three different intensity levels of pure tones (i.e., supra-, near-, and sub-threshold stimulation; 250-2,000 Hz). Our aim was to obtain ECochG potentials with differing SNRs. To objectify the detection of CM signals, we compared three different methods: correlation analysis, Hotelling's T2 test, and deep learning. We benchmarked these methods against the visual analysis of three ECochG experts. Result(s): For the visual analysis of ECochG recordings, the Fleiss' kappa value demonstrated a substantial to almost perfect agreement among the three examiners. We used the labels as ground truth to train our objectification methods. Thereby, the deep learning algorithm performed best (area under curve = 0.97, accuracy = 0.92), closely followed by Hotelling's T2 test. The correlation method slightly underperformed due to its susceptibility to noise interference. Conclusion(s): Objectification of ECochG signals is possible with the presented methods. Deep learning and Hotelling's T2 methods achieved excellent discrimination performance. Objective automatic analysis of CM signals enables standardized, fast, accurate, and examiner-independent evaluation of ECochG measurements.Copyright © 2022 Schuerch, Wimmer, Dalbert, Rummel, Caversaccio, Mantokoudis and Weder.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2022.943816,SFX,

Only 20% of the people in need of a hearing assistive device will eventually seek and acquire one. The number of people that are satisfied with their Hearing Aids (HAids) and continue using them in the long term is even lower. Understanding the personal, behavioral, environmental, or other factors that correlate with the optimal HAid fitting and with users' experience of HAids is a significant step in improving patient satisfaction and quality of life, while reducing societal and financial burden. In SMART BEAR we are addressing this need by making use of the capacity of modern HAids to provide dynamic logging of their operation and by combining this information with a big amount of information about the medical, environmental, and social context of each HAid user. We are studying hearing rehabilitation through a 12-month continuous monitoring of HL patients, collecting data, such as participants' demographics, audiometric and medical data, their cognitive and mental status, their habits, and preferences, through a set of medical devices and wearables, as well as through face-to-face and remote clinical assessments and fitting/fine-tuning sessions. Descriptive, AI-based analysis and assessment of the relationships between heterogeneous data and HL-related parameters will help clinical researchers to better understand the overall health profiles of HL patients, and to identify patterns or relations that may be proven essential for future clinical trials. In addition, the future state and behavioral (e.g., HAids Satisfiability and HAids usage) of the patients will be predicted with time-dependent machine learning models to assist the clinical researchers to decide on the nature of the interventions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques will be leveraged to better understand the factors that play a significant role in the success of a hearing rehabilitation program, constructing patient profiles. This paper is a conceptual one aiming to describe the upcoming data collection process and proposed framework for providing a comprehensive profile for patients with HL in the context of EU-funded SMART BEAR project. Such patient profiles can be invaluable in HL treatment as they can help to identify the characteristics making patients more prone to drop out and stop using their HAids, using their HAids sufficiently long during the day, and being more satisfied by their HAids experience. They can also help decrease the number of needed remote sessions with their Audiologist for counseling, and/or HAids fine tuning, or the number of manual changes of HAids program (as indication of poor sound quality and bad adaptation of HAids configuration to patients' real needs and daily challenges), leading to reduced healthcare cost.Copyright © 2022 Iliadou, Su, Kikidis, Bibas and Kloukinas.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2022.933940,SFX,

Speech intelligibility can be used to estimate the extent to which the auditory prosthesis improves the user's speech comprehension. Although behavior-based speech intelligibility is the gold standard, precise evaluation is limited due to its subjectiveness. Here, we used a convolutional neural network to predict speech intelligibility from electroencephalography (EEG). Sixty-four-channel EEGs were recorded from 87 adult participants with normal hearing. Sentences spectrally degraded by a 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 8-channel vocoder were used to set relatively low speech intelligibility conditions. A Korean sentence recognition test was used. The speech intelligibility scores were divided into 41 discrete levels ranging from 0 to 100%, with a step of 2.5%. Three scores, namely 30.0, 37.5, and 40.0%, were not collected. The speech features, i.e., the speech temporal envelope (ENV) and phoneme (PH) onset, were used to extract continuous-speech EEGs for speech intelligibility prediction. The deep learning model was trained by a dataset of event-related potentials (ERP), correlation coefficients between the ERPs and ENVs, between the ERPs and PH onset, or between ERPs and the product of the multiplication of PH and ENV (PHENV). The speech intelligibility prediction accuracies were 97.33% (ERP), 99.42% (ENV), 99.55% (PH), and 99.91% (PHENV). The models were interpreted using the occlusion sensitivity approach. While the ENV models' informative electrodes were located in the occipital area, the informative electrodes of the phoneme models, i.e., PH and PHENV, were based on the occlusion sensitivity map located in the language processing area. Of the models tested, the PHENV model obtained the best speech intelligibility prediction accuracy. This model may promote clinical prediction of speech intelligibility with a comfort speech intelligibility test.Copyright © 2022 Na, Joo, Trang, Quan and Woo.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.906616,SFX,

To explore the topological characteristics of the brain connectome following SNHL from the global level and nodal level, we recruited 36 bilateral SNHL patients with tinnitus and 37 well-matched healthy controls. Every subject underwent pure tone audiometry tests, neuropsychological assessments, and MRI scanning. AAL atlas was employed to divide a brain into 90 cortical and subcortical regions of interest, then investigated the global and nodal properties of ""small world"" network in SNHL and control groups using a graph-theory analysis. The global characteristics include small worldness, cluster coefficient, characteristic path length, local efficiency, and global efficiency. Node properties include degree centrality, betweenness centrality, nodal efficiency, and nodal clustering coefficient. Interregional connectivity analysis was also computed among 90 nodes. We found that the SNHL group had significantly higher hearing thresholds and cognitive impairments, as well as disrupted internal connections among 90 nodes. SNHL group displayed lower AUC of cluster coefficient and path length lambda, but increased global efficiency. The opercular and triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, rectus gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, and amygdala showed abnormal local features. Some of these connectome alterations were correlated with cognitive ability and the duration of SNHL. This study may prove potential imaging biomarkers and treatment targets for future studies.Copyright © 2022 Hua, Xu, Xu, Xu, Hu, Xue and Wu.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.898902,SFX,

In the field of perception, such modulatory effects have been described in distinct sensory modalities. In the present study we focused on the auditory channel and aimed at creating a radical deafness to elementary sounds by a specific hypnotic suggestion. We report here a single case-study in a highly suggestible healthy volunteer who reported a total hypnotically suggested deafness. We recorded high-density scalp EEG during an auditory odd-ball paradigm before and after hypnotic deafness suggestion. While both early auditory event-related potentials to sounds (P1) and mismatch negativity component were not affected by hypnotic deafness, we observed a total disappearance of the late P3 complex component when the subject reported being deaf. Moreover, a centro-mesial positivity was present exclusively during the hypnotic condition prior to the P3 complex. Interestingly, source localization suggested an anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) origin of this neural event. Multivariate decoding analyses confirmed and specified these findings. Resting state analyses confirmed a similar level of conscious state in both conditions, and suggested a functional disconnection between auditory areas and other cortical areas. Taken together these results suggest the following plausible scenario: (i) preserved early processing of auditory information unaffected by hypnotic suggestion, (ii) conscious setting of an inhibitory process (ACC) preventing conscious access to sounds, (iii) functional disconnection between the modular and unconscious representations of sounds and global neuronal workspace. This single subject study presents several limits that are discussed and remains open to alternative interpretations. This original proof-of-concept paves the way to a larger study that will test the predictions stemming from our theoretical model and from this first report.Copyright © 2022 Munoz Musat, Rohaut, Sangare, Benhaiem and Naccache.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.756651,SFX,

Persistent hearing loss is associated with poor childhood speech and language development and other adverse consequence. However, to obtain accurate and reliable hearing thresholds largely requires a high degree of cooperation from the patients. Objective(s): To predict CHL from otoscopic images using deep learning (DL) techniques and a logistic regression model based on tympanic membrane features. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A retrospective diagnostic/prognostic study was conducted using 2790 otoscopic images obtained from multiple centers between January 2015 and November 2020. Participants were aged between 4 and 89 years. Of 1239 participants, there were 209 ears from children and adolescents (aged 4-18 years [16.87%]), 804 ears from adults (aged 18-60 years [64.89%]), and 226 ears from older people (aged >60 years, [18.24%]). Overall, 679 ears (54.8%) were from men. The 2790 otoscopic images were randomly assigned into a training set (2232 [80%]), and validation set (558 [20%]). The DL model was developed to predict an average air-bone gap greater than 10 dB. A logistic regression model was also developed based on otoscopic features. Main Outcomes and Measures: The performance of the DL model in predicting CHL was measured using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1 score (a measure of the quality of a classifier, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall; a higher F1 score means better performance). In addition, these evaluation parameters were compared to results obtained from the logistic regression model and predictions made by three otologists. Result(s): The performance of the DL model in predicting CHL showed the AUC of 0.74, accuracy of 81%, and F1 score of 0.89. This was better than the results from the logistic regression model (ie, AUC of 0.60, accuracy of 76%, and F1 score of 0.82), and much improved on the performance of the 3 otologists; accuracy of 16%, 30%, 39%, and F1 scores of 0.09, 0.18, and 0.25, respectively. Furthermore, the DL model took 2.5 seconds to predict from 205 otoscopic images, whereas the 3 otologists spent 633 seconds, 645 seconds, and 692 seconds, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: The model in this diagnostic/prognostic study provided greater accuracy in prediction of CHL in ears with OME than those obtained from the logistic regression model and otologists. This indicates great potential for the use of artificial intelligence tools to facilitate CHL evaluation when CHL is unable to be measured.Copyright © 2022 American Medical Association.

However, it is well known that elderly people suffer more frequently from hearing loss. Two different model approaches were employed: A generalised linear model and a random forest regression model were used to quantify the relationship between pure-tone hearing loss, age, and speech perception. Both models were applied to a large clinical data set of 19,801 ears, covering all degrees of hearing loss. They allow the estimation of age-related decline in speech recognition for different types of audiograms. Our results show that speech scores depend on the specific type of hearing loss and life decade. We found age effects for all degrees of hearing loss. A deterioration in speech recognition of up to 25 percentage points across the whole life span was observed for constant pure-tone thresholds. The largest decrease was 10 percentage points per life decade. This age-related decline in speech recognition cannot be explained by elevated hearing thresholds as measured by pure-tone audiometry.Copyright © 2022 Hoppe, Hocke and Iro.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnagi.2022.891202,SFX,

However, the presence of the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) on the surface of the inner ear capillaries greatly hinders the effectiveness of systemic drugs for prevention and intervention due to the low permeability, which restricts the entry of most drug compounds from the bloodstream into the inner ear tissue. Here, we report the finding of a novel receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), that is expressed on the BLB, as a potential target for shuttling therapeutics across this barrier. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an LRP1-binding peptide, IETP2, and covalently conjugated a series of model small-molecule compounds to it, including potential drugs and imaging agents. All compounds were successfully delivered into the inner ear and inner ear lymph, indicating that targeting the receptor LRP1 is a promising strategy to enhance the permeability of the BLB. The discovery of the receptor LRP1 will illuminate developing strategies for crossing the BLB and for improving systemic drug delivery for inner ear disorders.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1038%2fs41392-022-00995-z,SFX,35680846 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=35680846]

However, little is known about changes of whole-brain functional networks in patients with UHL and whether differences exist in topological organization between right-sided UHL (RUHL) and left-sided UHL (LUHL). To address this issue, we employed resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and graph-theoretical approaches to investigate the topological alterations of brain functional connectomes in patients with RUHL and LUHL. Data from 44 patients with UHL (including 22 RUHL patients and 22 LUHL patients) and 37 healthy control subjects (HCs) were collected. Functional brain networks were constructed for each participant, following by graph-theoretical network analyses at connectional and global (e.g., small-worldness) levels. The correlations between brain network topologies and clinical variables were further studied. Using network-based analysis, we found a subnetwork in the visual cortex which had significantly lower connectivity strength in patients with RUHL as compared to HCs. At global level, all participants showed small-world architecture in functional brain networks, however, significantly lower normalized clustering coefficient and small-worldness were observed in patients with RUHL than in HCs. Moreover, these abnormal network metrics were demonstrated to be correlated with the clinical variables and cognitive performance of patients with RUHL. Notably, no significant alterations in the functional brain networks were found in patients with LUHL. Our findings demonstrate that RUHL (rather than LUHL) is accompanied with aberrant topological organization of the functional brain connectome, indicating different pathophysiological mechanisms between RUHL and LUHL from a viewpoint of network topology.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1007%2fs11682-022-00658-1,SFX,35397062 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=35397062]

Graph theory analysis brings a new understanding of the structural connectome and topological features in central neural system diseases. However, little is known about the structural network connectome changes in SNHL patients, especially in children. We explored the differences in topologic organization, rich-club organization, and structural connection between children with congenital bilateral profound SNHL and normal hearing under the age of three using graph theory analysis and probabilistic tractography. Compared with the normal-hearing (NH) group, the SNHL group showed no difference in global and nodal topological parameters. Increased structural connection strength were found in the right cortico-striatal-thalamus-cortical circuity. Decreased cross-hemisphere connections were found between the right precuneus and the left auditory cortex as well as the left subcortical regions. Rich-club organization analysis found increased local connection in the SNHL group.

Seven of the 25 most widely used treatment are sound based therapies, but no methods to select an appropriate one have been established. Method(s): Therefore, this investigation aimed to establish a method to select an appropriate acoustic therapy by finding comparable psycho-neurological effects. For that purpose, 71 Mexican volunteers (60 tinnitus sufferers and 11 controls) followed one of five two-month treatments that aimed to (1) diminish the level of attention towards tinnitus via neuro-modulation, (2) habituate to tinnitus by retraining or (3) to relieve distress (binaural beats and music). From the treatment outcomes, six features were defined: (1) hearing loss, (2) anxiety level, (3) stress level, (4) overall amount of neural electrical response to acoustic therapy, (5) EEG channel wherefrom the maximum neural response was obtained, and (6) assigned group. Then, a cluster analysis based on the k-means method was undertaken. Result(s): As a result, a strong structure (silhouette measure = 0.798) of six clusters showed that tinnitus sufferers who reported diminution of stress and anxiety, and no side effects, mainly proceeded from neuro-modulation treatments. Furthermore, most of tinnitus sufferers who reported increase of anxiety mainly proceeded from tinnitus retraining and binaural beats. Finally, tinnitus sufferers who only reported anxiety diminution mainly proceeded from tinnitus retraining and music therapy. Conclusion(s): Taken together, these findings are a guideline to select an appropriate therapy according to clinical history and psycho-neurological effects, what has not been proposed until now.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2022.103719,SFX,

Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) are evolutionarily conserved cytoskeletal proteins that regulate the nucleation of linear unbranched actin filaments. They play key roles during meta-zoan development, and they seem particularly pivotal for the correct physiology of the reproductive and auditory systems. Indeed, in Drosophila melanogaster, a single diaphanous (dia) gene is present, and mutants show sterility and impaired response to sound. Vertebrates, instead, have three orthologs of the diaphanous gene: DIAPH1, DIAPH2, and DIAPH3. In humans, defects in DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 have been associated with different types of hearing loss. In particular, heterozygous mutations in DIAPH1 are responsible for autosomal dominant deafness with or without thrombocytopenia (DFNA1, MIM #124900), whereas regulatory mutations inducing the overexpression of DIAPH3 cause autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy 1 (AUNA1, MIM #609129). Here, we provide an overview of the expression and function of DRFs in normal hearing and deafness.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

The clinical manifestations of SLC26A4 mutation-related hearing loss are congenital sensorineural or mixed deafness. Sensitive and specific SLC26A4 mutation detection in the early clinical stage is key for the early indication of potential hearing loss in the lack of effective treatment. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based nucleic acid detection technology, we designed a fast and sensitive detection system for SLC26A4 pathogenic mutations (c.919-2A > G, c.2168A > G and c.1229C > T). This recombinase-aided amplification-based detection system allows rapid target gene amplification and, in combination with the CRISPR-based nucleic acid testing (NAT) system, mutation site detection. Moreover, mismatches were introduced in CRISPR-derived RNA (crRNA) to increase signal differences between the wild-type genes and mutant genes. A total of 64 samples were examined using this approach and all results were verified using Sanger sequencing. The detection results were consistent with the polymerase chain reaction-Sanger sequencing results. Overall, this CRISPR-based NAT technology provides a sensitive and fast new approach for the detection of hereditary deafness and provides a crRNA optimization strategy for single-nucleotide polymorphism detection, which could be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of SLC26A4 mutation-related hereditary hearing loss.Copyright © 2021",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.ejmg.2021.104406,SFX,34968750 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34968750]

We analyzed event-related electroencephalograms (EEGs) to observe auditory-related brain function and explore the possible effects of SNHL on auditory processing in tinnitus patients. Method(s): Speech discrimination scores (SDSs) were recorded in 21 healthy control subjects, 24 tinnitus patients, 24 SNHL patients, and 27 patients with both SNHL and tinnitus. EEGs were collected under an oddball paradigm. Then, the mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude and latency, the clustering coefficient and average path length of the whole network in the tinnitus and SNHL groups were compared with those in the control group. Additionally, we analyzed the intergroup differences in functional connectivity among the primary auditory cortex (AC), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Result(s): SNHL patients with or without tinnitus had lower SDSs than the control subjects. Compared with control subjects, tinnitus patients with or without SNHL had decreased MMN amplitudes, and SNHL patients had longer MMN latencies. Tinnitus patients without SNHL had a smaller clustering coefficient and a longer whole-brain average path length than the control subjects. SNHL patients with or without tinnitus had a smaller clustering coefficient and a longer average path length than patients with tinnitus alone. The connectivity strength from the AC to the PHG and IFG was lower on the affected side in tinnitus patients than that in control subjects; the connectivity strength from the PHG to the IFG was also lower on the affected side in tinnitus patients than that in control subjects. However, the connectivity strength from the IFG to the AC was stronger in tinnitus patients than that in the control subjects. In SNHL patients with or without tinnitus, these changes were magnified. Conclusion(s): Changes in auditory processing in tinnitus patients do not influence SDSs. Instead, SNHL might cause the activity of the AC, PHG and IFG to change, resulting in impaired speech recognition in tinnitus patients with SNHL.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Zhao, Zou, Wen, Zhou, Yu, Liu and Li.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2022.816712,SFX,

However, high accuracy diagnostics of SNHL and prognostic prediction of CI are lacking to date. To diagnose SNHL and predict the outcome of CI, we propose a method combining functional connections (FCs) measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and machine learning. A total of 68 children with SNHL and 34 healthy controls (HC) of matched age and gender were recruited to construct classification models for SNHL and HC. A total of 52 children with SNHL that underwent CI were selected to establish a predictive model of the outcome measured by the category of auditory performance (CAP), and their resting-state fMRI images were acquired. After the dimensional reduction of FCs by kernel principal component analysis, three machine learning methods including the support vector machine, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbor and their voting were used as the classifiers. A multiple logistic regression method was performed to predict the CAP of CI. The classification model of voting achieves an area under the curve of 0.84, which is higher than that of three single classifiers. The multiple logistic regression model predicts CAP after CI in SNHL with an average accuracy of 82.7%. These models may improve the identification of SNHL through fMRI images and prognosis prediction of CI in SNHL.Copyright © 2022 Song, Qi, Jin, Yang, Qian, Yin, Zhao and Yu.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffncom.2022.825160,SFX,

However, recent ABR applications to detect human cochlear synaptopathy have led to inconsistent results, mainly due to the high variability of ABR wave-1 amplitude. Here, rather than focusing on the amplitude of ABR wave 1, we evaluated the use of ABR wave curvature to detect cochlear synaptic loss. We first compared four curvature quantification methods using simulated ABR waves, and identified that the cubic spline method using five data points produced the most accurate quantification. We next evaluated this quantification method with ABR data from an established mouse model with cochlear synaptopathy. The data clearly demonstrated that curvature measurement is more sensitive and consistent in identifying cochlear synaptic loss in mice compared to the amplitude and latency measurements. We further tested this curvature method in a different mouse model presenting with otitis media. The change in curvature profile due to middle ear infection in otitis media is different from the profile of mice with cochlear synaptopathy. Thus, our study suggests that curvature quantification can be used to address the current ABR variability issue, and may lead to additional applications in the clinic diagnosis of hearing disorders.Copyright © 2022 Bao, Jegede, Hawks, Dade, Guan, Middaugh, Qiu, Levina and Tsai.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffncel.2022.851500,SFX,

Considered a complex disease, little is known about its pathogenesis. Over the past 20 years, ten autosomal dominant loci (OTSC1-10) have been mapped but no genes identified. Herein, we map a new OTSC locus to a 9.96 Mb region within the FOX gene cluster on 16q24.1 and identify a 15 bp coding deletion in Forkhead Box L1 co-segregating with otosclerosis in a Caucasian family. Pre-operative phenotype ranges from moderate to severe hearing loss to profound sensorineural loss requiring a cochlear implant. Mutant FOXL1 is both transcribed and translated and correctly locates to the cell nucleus. However, the deletion of 5 residues in the C-terminus of mutant FOXL1 causes a complete loss of transcriptional activity due to loss of secondary (alpha helix) structure. FOXL1 (rs764026385) was identified in a second unrelated case on a shared background. We conclude that FOXL1 (rs764026385) is pathogenic and causes autosomal dominant otosclerosis and propose a key inhibitory role for wildtype Foxl1 in bone remodelling in the otic capsule. New insights into the molecular pathology of otosclerosis from this study provide molecular targets for non-invasive therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1007%2fs00439-021-02381-1,SFX,34633540 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34633540]

Aim(s): To demonstrate the value of acoustic analysis in clinical practice as a reliable complement to perceptive judgment. Methods & Procedures: We compared the acoustic signature and the perceptive detection of vocoid epentheses in unvoiced consonant clusters within pseudo-words produced by 40 participants presenting different subtypes of motor speech disorders (including apraxia of speech (AoS) and dysarthria) and matched neurotypical controls. Outcomes & Results: The results indicate that vocoid epenthesis was acoustically visible in 3 out of 10 participants with AoS, and in one out of 30 participants with dysarthria. One-quarter of these vocoid epentheses was not detected via auditory perception by expert listeners (speech and language therapists) who also made false detections. Conclusion(s): The current results indicate that vocoid epenthesis is not systematic at least in mild AoS. Moreover, an important proportion is misdetected by ear, even by expert clinicians, meaning that visualisation of the acoustic signal can be of precious help.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

However, the underlying mechanism behind HL in AD remains elusive. A possible mechanism is cognitive load hypothesis, which postulates that over-processing of degraded auditory signals in the auditory cortex leads to deficits in other cognitive functions. Given mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD, untangling the association between HL and MCI might provide insights for potential mechanism behind HL. Method(s): We included 85 cognitively normal (CN) subjects with no hearing loss (NHL), 24 CN with HL, 103 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with NHL, and 23 MCI with HL from the ADNI database. All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological scale assessments. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was used to reflect spontaneous brain activity. The mixed-effects analysis was applied to explore the interactive effects between HL and cognitive status (GRF corrected, voxel p-value <0.005, cluster p-value < 0.05, two-tailed). Then, the FDG data was included to further reflect the regional neuronal abnormalities. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis was performed between imaging metrics and cognitive scores to explore the clinical significance (Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.05). Result(s): The interactive effects primarily located in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and bilateral inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). Post-hoc analysis showed that NC with HL had lower fALFF in bilateral ITG compared to NC with NHL. NC with HL had higher fALFF in the left STG and decreased fALFF in bilateral ITG compared to MCI with HL. In addition, NC with HL had lower fALFF in the right ITG compared to MCI with NHL. Correlation analysis revealed that fALFF was associated with MMSE and ADNI-VS, while SUVR was associated with MMSE, MoCA, ADNI-EF and ADNI-Lan. Conclusion(s): HL showed different effects on NC and MCI stages. NC had increased spontaneous brain activity in auditory cortex while decreased activity in the ITG. Such pattern altered with disease stage changing and manifested as decreased activity in auditory cortex along with increased activity in ITG in MCI. This suggested that the cognitive load hypothesis may be the underlying mechanism behind HL.Copyright © 2022 Hong, Zeng, Li, Luo, Xu, Liu, Li, Fu, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Liu, Huang and Zhang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.3389%2ffnagi.2021.772136,SFX,

However, sound source localization is severely compromised for patients with hearing loss who receive bilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs). Several patient factors relate to poorer performance in listeners with BiCIs, associated with auditory deprivation, experience, and age. Critically, characteristic errors are made by patients with BiCIs (e.g., medial responses at lateral target locations), and the relationship between patient factors and the type of errors made by patients has seldom been investigated across individuals. In the present study, several different types of analysis were used to understand localization errors and their relationship with patient-dependent factors (selected based on their robustness of prediction). Binaural hearing experience is required for developing accurate localization skills, auditory deprivation is associated with degradation of the auditory periphery, and aging leads to poorer temporal resolution. Therefore, it was hypothesized that earlier onsets of deafness would be associated with poorer localization acuity and longer periods without BiCI stimulation or older age would lead to greater amounts of variability in localization responses. A novel machine learning approach was introduced to characterize the types of errors made by listeners with BiCIs, making them simple to interpret and generalizable to everyday experience. Sound localization performance was measured in 48 listeners with BiCIs using pink noise trains presented in free-field. Our results suggest that older age at testing and earlier onset of deafness are associated with greater average error, particularly for sound sources near the center of the head, consistent with previous research. The machine learning analysis revealed that variability of localization responses tended to be greater for individuals with earlier compared to later onsets of deafness. These results suggest that early bilateral hearing is essential for best sound source localization outcomes in listeners with BiCIs.Copyright: © 2022 Anderson et al.

Treatment relies on the accurate diagnosis of hearing loss; however, this first step is out of reach for >80% of those affected. Increasingly automated approaches are being developed for self-administered digital hearing assessments without the direct involvement of professionals. Objective(s): This study aims to provide an overview of digital approaches in automated and machine learning assessments of hearing using pure-tone audiometry and to focus on the aspects related to accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency. This review is an extension of a 2013 systematic review. Method(s): A search across the electronic databases of PubMed, IEEE, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant reports from the peer-reviewed literature. Key information about each report's scope and details was collected to assess the commonalities among the approaches. Result(s): A total of 56 reports from 2012 to June 2021 were included. From this selection, 27 unique automated approaches were identified. Machine learning approaches require fewer trials than conventional threshold-seeking approaches, and personal digital devices make assessments more affordable and accessible. Validity can be enhanced using digital technologies for quality surveillance, including noise monitoring and detecting inconclusive results. Conclusion(s): In the past 10 years, an increasing number of automated approaches have reported similar accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency as manual hearing assessments. New developments, including machine learning approaches, offer features, versatility, and cost-effectiveness beyond manual audiometry. Used within identified limitations, automated assessments using digital devices can support task-shifting, self-care, telehealth, and clinical care pathways.Copyright ©Jan-Willem Wasmann, Leontien Pragt, Robert Eikelboom, De Wet Swanepoel.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.2196%2f32581,SFX,34919056 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34919056]

Besides auditory consequences, the literature recently found an association between hearing loss and cognitive decline over the last two decades, emphasizing the importance of the early detection of presbycusis. However, the current hearing tests are not sufficient to detect presbycusis in some cases. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of this association are still under discussion, calling for a new field of research on that topic. In that context, this study investigates for the first time the interaction between presbycusis, eye movement latency and Stroop scores for a normal aging population. Hearing abilities, eye movement latency and the Stroop Victoria test were measured for 69 elderly (mean 66.7 +/- 8.4) and 30 young (mean 25.3 +/- 2.7) participants. The results indicated a significant relationship between saccade latency and speech audiometry in the silence score, independently from age. These promising results suggest common attentional mechanisms between speech processing and saccade latency. The results are discussed regarding the relationship between hearing and cognition, and regarding the perspective of expanding new tools for presbycusis diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

Indeed, there may be other upper airway-related predisposing factors such as, location of the adenoid, accompanying tonsillar hypertrophy (TH) and nasal septal deviation (NSD) for the development of OME. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the associations between the upper airway physicals and OME with auditory functions. Method(s): Eighty-six ears of 43 children, aged 3-11 years were included in this prospective clinical study. Findings of otolaryngologic examinations were noted. Data of pure tone audiometry (PTA), traditional tympanometry (TT) and wideband tympanometry (WBT) parameters were collected. Cluster analysis was performed to the following variables: age, sex; the adenoid choana percentage (ACP), the presences of adenoid around torus tubarius (AATT), TH, NSD and OME; peak pressure (PP) values on TT, resonance frequencies (RF) on WBT, ambient pressure absorbance ratios (APAR) and PTA hearing thresholds. Result(s): Two groups of ears revealed by clustering; cluster-1 (n = 46) and cluster-2 (n = 40), at the similarity level of 0.662. The presences of AH, AATT, OME and the medians of ACP, PP, RF, WBT APARs at all frequencies except 5656 Hz and 8000 Hz, all PTA thresholds were significantly different between two clusters (p < 0.05). The lower WBT APARs and higher PTA thresholds were associated with higher levels of ACP and higher frequencies of the presence of AATT and OME in cluster-1. Conclusion(s): There are associations between AH, AATT and OME together with decline in hearing and SEA.

Evolutionary algorithms (EA) can explore a large set of potential solutions in a stochastic manner to approach the optimum of a minimization problem. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an EA-based protocol to modify the default frequency settings of a MAP (fMAP) of the CI in patients with bimodal hearing. Method(s): This monocentric prospective study included 27 adult CI users (with post-lingual deafness and contralateral functional hearing). A fitting program based on EA was developed to approach the best fMAP. Generated fMAPs were tested by speech recognition (word recognition score, WRS) in noise and free-field-like conditions. By combining these first fMAPs and adding some random changes, a total of 13 fMAPs over 3 generations were produced. Participants were evaluated before and 45 to 60 days after the fitting by WRS in noise and questionnaires on global sound quality and music perception in bimodal binaural conditions. Result(s): WRS in noise improved with the EA-based fitting in comparison to the default fMAP (41.67 +/- 9.70% versus 64.63 +/- 16.34%, respectively, p = 0.0001, signed-rank test). The global sound quality and music perception were also improved, as judged by ratings on questionnaires and scales. Finally, most patients chose to keep the new fitting definitively.

Generally, a hearing aid amplifies sounds so that a hearing-impaired person can listen, converse, and actively engage in daily activities. Presently, there are some sophisticated hearing aid algorithms available that operate on numerous frequency bands to not only amplify but also provide tuning and noise filtering to minimize background distractions. One of those is the BioAid assistive hearing system, which is an open-source, freely available downloadable app with twenty-four tuning settings. Critically, with this device, a person suffering with hearing loss must manually alter the settings/tuning of their hearing device when their surroundings and scene changes in order to attain a comfortable level of hearing. However, this manual switching among multiple tuning settings is inconvenient and cumbersome since the user is forced to switch to the state that best matches the scene every time the auditory environment changes. The goal of this study is to eliminate this manual switching and automate the BioAid with a scene classification algorithm so that the system automatically identifies the user-selected preferences based on adequate training. The aim of acoustic scene classification is to recognize the audio signature of one of the predefined scene classes that best represent the environment in which it was recorded. BioAid, an open-source biological inspired hearing aid algorithm, is used after conversion to Python. The proposed method consists of two main parts: classification of auditory scenes and selection of hearing aid tuning settings based on user experiences. The DCASE2017 dataset is utilized for scene classification. Among the many classifiers that were trained and tested, random forests have the highest accuracy of 99.7%. In the second part, clean speech audios from the LJ speech dataset are combined with scenes, and the user is asked to listen to the resulting audios and adjust the presets and subsets. A CSV file stores the selection of presets and subsets at which the user can hear clearly against the scenes. Various classifiers are trained on the dataset of user preferences. After training, clean speech audio was convolved with the scene and fed as input to the scene classifier that predicts the scene. The predicted scene was then fed as input to the preset classifier that predicts the user's choice for preset and subset. The BioAid is automatically tuned to the predicted selection. The accuracy of random forest in the prediction of presets and subsets was 100%. This proposed approach has great potential to eliminate the tedious manual switching of hearing assistive device parameters by allowing hearing-impaired individuals to actively participate in daily life by automatically adjusting hearing aid settings based on the acoustic scene.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3390%2fs22208031,SFX,36298382 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36298382]

This study aimed to examine the association between exposure to 7 personal care and consumer product chemicals and hearing thresholds in middle-aged and elderly people. A nationally representative cross-sectional study was performed. Eight hundred forty-five adults aged over 45 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in this study. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and the k-medoid cluster analysis were used to evaluate the mixture effect of exposure to 7 chemicals on pure-tone average (PTA). Exposure to these chemicals was negatively associated with PTA. 2,5-Dichlorophenol had the greatest contribution to the mixture effect. The mixture effect was stronger in women, elderly people. Four pooled clusters were identified according to 7 chemicals exposures. Cluster 4 (high TCS exposure) showed a lower HFPTA (P=0.00258) than cluster 3 (the lowest exposure cluster, as a reference).

Motivated by the Conservation of Hearing Study (CHEARS) Audiology Assessment Arm (AAA) where repeated hearing measurements were clustered by study participants, time, and testing sites, we propose two methods to account for the multilevel correlation structure when fitting the MSMs. The first method directly models the covariance of the repeated outcomes when solving the weighted generalized estimating equations for MSMs, while the second two-stage analysis approach fits cluster-specific MSMs first and then combines the estimated parameters using mixed-effects meta-analysis. Finite sample simulation results suggest that our methods can obtain less biased and more efficient estimates of the parameters by accounting for the multilevel correlation. Moreover, we explore the effects of using fixed- or mixed-effects model to estimate the treatment probability on the parameter estimates of the MSMs in the presence of unmeasured cluster-level confounders.

METHOD(S): Seven different ML techniques, including transparent (i.e., decision tree and logistic regression) and opaque (e.g., random forest) models, were trained and evaluated on a data set including 215 tested ears (99 with hearing loss of mild degree or higher and 116 with no hearing loss). Post hoc explainability techniques were applied to highlight the role of each feature in predicting hearing loss. RESULT(S): Random forest (accuracy = .85, sensitivity = .86, specificity = .85, precision = .84) performed, on average, better than decision tree (accuracy = .82, sensitivity = .84, specificity = .80, precision = .79). Support vector machine, logistic regression, and gradient boosting had similar performance as random forest. According to post hoc explainability analysis on models generated using random forest, the features with the highest relevance in predicting hearing loss were age, number and percentage of correct responses, and average reaction time, whereas the total test time had the lowest relevance. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates that a multivariate approach can help detect hearing loss with satisfactory performance.

We found that garland chrysanthemum consumption ameliorated age-related hearing loss (AHL) in C57BL/6J mice, an early onset model. We also found that AHL progression was significantly ameliorated by three of ten products. Metabolome analysis of the 10 products using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy indicated that phytosterols may be involved in the amelioration of AHL. However, the direct inhibitory effect of phytosterol mixture on mouse AHL progression was not identified. These results suggest that garland chrysanthemum consumption delays AHL development in mice and its efficiency varies depending on the source of the product. Our findings also suggest that phytosterol content in garland chrysanthemum functions as an evaluation marker for the efficiency. Furthermore, to accelerate the search for foods that prevent AHL, we have used these data to develop an automatic threshold determination method for auditory brainstem response using machine learning.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Preoperative verbal learning and memory abilities of the CIC group were compared with a group of older normal-hearing (ONH) control participants. Relations between preoperative verbal learning and memory measures and speech recognition outcomes after 6 mo of CI use were also investigated for a subgroup of the CICs. DESIGN: A group of 80 older adult participants completed a visually presented multitrial free recall task. Measures of word recall, repetition learning, and the use of self-generated organizational strategies were collected from a group of 49 CICs, before cochlear implantation, and a group of 31 ONH controls. Speech recognition outcomes were also collected from a subgroup of 32 of the CIC participants who returned for testing 6 mo after CI activation. RESULT(S): CICs demonstrated poorer verbal learning performance compared with the group of ONH control participants. Among the preoperative verbal learning and memory measures, repetition learning slope and measures of self-generated organizational clustering strategies were the strongest predictors of post-CI speech recognition outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Older adult CI candidates present with verbal learning and memory deficits compared with older adults without hearing loss, even on visual tasks that are independent from the direct effects of audibility. Preoperative verbal learning and memory processes reflecting repetition learning and self-generated organizational strategies in free recall were associated with speech recognition outcomes 6 months after implantation. The pattern of results suggests that visual measures of verbal learning may be a useful predictor of outcomes in postlingual adult CICs.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The tuning curves were estimated at 1 kHz and the contributions of the OHC and IHC pathologies to the tuning curve were distinguished by the model. Furthermore, the phase locking of AN spikes were simulated in quiet and in presence of noise. The model predicts that the phase locking drastically deteriorates in noise indicating the disturbing effect of background noise on the temporal coding in case of hearing impairment. Moreover, the paper presents an example wherein the model is inversely configured for diagnostic purposes using a machine learning optimization technique (Nelder-Mead method).

Machine learning may enable prediction of objective hearing loss from common patient information for potential point-of-care application. This study aims to develop a machinelearning model to predict hearing level from demographics, clinical factors, and subjective assessment of hearing. Method(s): The study cohort included 6566 adults (>=20 years) who completed audiometric testing in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2012 to 2018. The primary outcome measure was the prediction of speech-frequency pure tone average (PTA) in the better-hearing ear. Relevant predictors included demographics, medical conditions, and subjective assessment of hearing. Supervised machine learning with a decision tree architecture was used. After model training, the relative influence of individual predictors on PTA was stratified. Model performance was determined by the mean absolute error (MAE). Result(s): The mean difference (MAE) between the predicted and actual PTA was 4.9 dB (95% CI, 4.7-5.1), indicating a reliable prediction of PTA from available demographic and clinical factors. The top 4 influential predictors of higher PTA were increased age, worse subjective hearing, male gender, and lower educational attainment. Age was the most influential factor with a mean contribution to model prediction of 4.2 dB followed by subjective assessment of hearing with a mean impact of 1.6 dB. Simplified prediction model of PTA including only top 4 predictors produced an MAE of 5.3 dB (95% CI, 5.2-5.4). Conclusion(s): Our machine-learning model was able to predict PTA accurately with patient demographics, clinical factors, and subjective assessment of hearing. With only a few basic features, adequate PTA prediction was still obtainable. Machine-learning-based prediction models may be used to reliably identify individuals who may benefit most from audiometric evaluation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1177%2f01945998221107672,SFX,

Many aspects such as duration of deafness, respective hearing loss, individual anatomy must be considered preoperatively in order to select an electrode and insertion depth that is optimal for the patient. For this purpose, an app was developed that takes these factors into account and provides doctors with an adequate support system. For the development of this app, the data of approx. 1300 patients who were supplied with a MED-EL Electrode were evaluated. In these patients, the individual history, preoperative hearing threshold and speech comprehension were examined. In addition, the respective anatomy of the cochlea and the postoperative electrode position were measured in the radiological imaging (CB-CT). Postoperative hearing loss and speech understanding with cochlear implants were also included. Using machine learning, a model was developed that uses this data to make a prediction for a cochlear implantation. After development, the model was tested on 750 additional patients to check the prediction. It was possible to determine values for the expected postoperative hearing threshold depending on the type of electrode and insertion depth. The resulting selection of the electrode and insertion depth (virtual CI-OP) could be used in cases. Deviations arise in cases with difficult insertion or a drop in amplitude with cochlear monitoring to preserve residual hearing before reaching the desired insertion depth. MyCI offers a recommendation for the recommended electrode length or insertion depth and enables a prediction of the expected hearing loss and the expected speech results before cochlear implantation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1055%2fs-0042-1746815,SFX,

Fridman G.",,,Elsevier B.V.,"Introduction: Neural implants are in common use to treat disorders, including deafness, chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders. These implants share a generic hardware and software architecture: an implanted pulse generator and battery that deliver pulsatile stimulation to multiple electrodes in a region related to the neurological disorder and pulse amplitude or pulse rate modulation proportional to healthy modulation in the system. This approach relies on hardware specificity and minimizes processing power with a computationally efficient algorithm, leading to significant clinical impact. However, all devices share a clinical ceiling. Cochlear implants (CIs), arguably the most successful implant, restore speech perception with 99% success rate but cannot restore pitch perception or music appreciation. Studies suggest that if auditory neurons were activated with fine timing closer to that of natural responses pitch would be restored. Here, we investigate using a machine learning (ML) algorithm to optimize the prediction of the desired firing patterns of the auditory afferents to assess the capabilities to have a real-time front-end capable of inducing naturalistic firing patterns for CIs or any system. Method(s): A detailed biophysical model of sound transmission, inner hair cell responses, and outer hair cell responses exists that can predict the timing of cochlear responses. Performing these calculations is too computationally costly for real-time CI stimulation. To capture these transformations in real-time, we train a network to learn the transformation from sound to afferent responses. We compare performance to the standard Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) algorithm for CIs. Networks with sizes from 25 to 1000 GRU nodes were trained on sinusoidal and step inputs at 400 Hz, a standard frequency in human speech (Fig. 1). Result(s): Even a 25 node RNN could reproduce fine timing with 4.4 percent error on a test set of sines and steps (Fig. 2). This trained network also transfer learned and captured features of natural sounds that are not captured by the CIS algorithm (Fig. 3A-B). Additionally, for 0.5 second test inputs, the ML algorithm completed the sound to spike rate conversion in 300x less time than the phenomenological model (Fig. 3C). This calculation occurs at a real-time compatible rate of 1 millisecond for 1 second of spike timing prediction on an i9 microprocessor. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that this is a feasible approach for real-time prosthetic use. We plan to test behavioral improvement with restoration of pitch perception in CI users as a steppingstone to a novel neural implant strategy.

Several publications indicate that machine learning may improve predictive accuracy of cochlear implant outcomes compared to classical statistical methods. However, existing studies are limited in terms of model validation and evaluating factors like sample size on predictive performance. We conduct a thorough examination of machine learning approaches to predict word recognition scores (WRS) measured approximately 12 months after implantation in adults with post-lingual hearing loss. This is the largest retrospective study of cochlear implant outcomes to date, evaluating 2,489 cochlear implant recipients from three clinics. We demonstrate that while machine learning models significantly outperform linear models in prediction of WRS, their overall accuracy remains limited (mean absolute error: 17.9-21.8). The models are robust across clinical cohorts, with predictive error increasing by at most 16% when evaluated on a clinic excluded from the training set. We show that predictive improvement is unlikely to be improved by increasing sample size alone, with doubling of sample size estimated to only increasing performance by 3% on the combined dataset. Finally, we demonstrate how the current models could support clinical decision making, highlighting that subsets of individuals can be identified that have a 94% chance of improving WRS by at least 10% points after implantation, which is likely to be clinically meaningful.

We have developed a novel automated speech-in-noise test that uses stimuli viable for use in non-native listeners. The test reliability has been demonstrated in laboratory settings and in uncontrolled environmental noise settings in previous studies. The aim of this study was: (i) to evaluate the ability of the test to identify hearing loss using multivariate logistic regression classifiers in a population of 148 unscreened adults and (ii) to evaluate the ear-level sound pressure levels generated by different earphones and headphones as a function of the test volume. The multivariate classifiers had sensitivity equal to 0.79 and specificity equal to 0.79 using both the full set of features extracted from the test as well as a subset of three features (speech recognition threshold, age, and number of correct responses). The analysis of the ear-level sound pressure levels showed substantial variability across transducer types and models, with earphones levels being up to 22 dB lower than those of headphones. Overall, these results suggest that the proposed approach might be viable for hearing screening in varying environments if an option to self-adjust the test volume is included and if headphones are used. Future research is needed to assess the viability of the test for screening at a distance, for example by addressing the influence of user interface, device, and settings, on a large sample of subjects with varying hearing loss.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1109%2fJBHI.2021.3100368,SFX,34314365 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34314365]

Therefore, accurately measuring hearing loss conditions is very important for proper patient understanding and treatment. In current-day practice, to quantify the level of hearing loss, physicians exploit specialized test scores such as the pure-tone audiometry (PTA) thresholds and speech discrimination scores (SDS) as quantitative metrics in examining a patient's auditory function. However, given that these metrics can be easily affected by various human factors, which includes intentional (or accidental) patient intervention, there are needs to cross validate the accuracy of each metric. By understanding a ""normal"" relationship between the SDS and PTA, physicians can reveal the need for re-testing, additional testing in different dimensions, and also potential malingering cases. For this purpose, in this work, we propose a prediction model for estimating the SDS of a patient by using PTA thresholds via a Random Forest-based machine learning approach to overcome the limitations of the conventional statistical (or even manual) methods. For designing and evaluating the Random Forest-based prediction model, we collected a large-scale dataset from 12,697 subjects, and report a SDS level prediction accuracy of 95.05% and 96.64% for the left and right ears, respectively. We also present comparisons with other widely-used machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron) to show the effectiveness of our proposed Random Forest-based approach.

The current study adopted the non-invasive auditory evoked-potential technique to investigate the hearing threshold of a stranded melon headed whale (Peponocephala electra) at a frequency range of between 9.5 and 181 kHz. It was found that, at the frequency range of from 10 to 100 kHz, hearing thresholds for the animal were between 20 and 65 dB higher than those of its phylogenetically closest species (Pygmy killer whale). The severe hearing loss in the melon headed whale was probably caused by transient intense anthropogenic sonar or chronic shipping noise exposures. The hearing loss could have been the cause for the observed temporal and spatial clustered stranding events. Therefore, there is need for noise mitigation strategies to reduce noise exposure levels for marine mammals in the coastal areas of China.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.113047,SFX,34861441 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34861441]

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Objective(s): Combine network pharmacology with experimental validation to explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying ELZC with a systematic viewpoint. Method(s): The chemical components of ELZC were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology database, and their possible target proteins were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction database. The putative ARHL-related target proteins were identified from the database: GeneCards and OMIM. We constructed the drug-target network as well as drug-disease specific protein-protein interaction networks and performed clustering and topological property analyses. Functional annotation and signaling pathways were performed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis. Finally, in vitro experiments were also performed to validate ELZC's key target proteins and treatment effects on ARHL. Result(s): In total, 63 chemical compounds from ELZC and 365 putative ARHL-related targets were identified, and 1860 ARHL-related targets were collected from the OMIM and GeneCards. A total of 145 shared targets of ELZC and ARHL were acquired by Venn diagram analysis. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that ELZC might exert its pharmacological effects in multiple biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and synaptic connections, and the potential targets might be associated with AKT, ERK, and STAT3, as well as other proteins. In vitro experiments revealed that ELZC pretreatment could decrease senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity in hydrogen peroxide-induced auditory hair cells, eliminate DNA damage, and reduce cellular senescence protein p21 and p53. Finally, Western blot analysis confirmed that ELZC could upregulate the predicted target ERK phosphorylation. Conclusion(s): We provide an integrative network pharmacology approach, in combination with in vitro experiments to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms governing ELZC treatment of ARHL. The protective effects of ELZC against ARHL were predicted to be associated with cellular senescence, inflammatory response, and synaptic connections which might be linked to various pathways such as JNK/STAT3 and ERK cascade signaling pathways. As a prosperous possibility, our experimental data suggest phosphorylation ERK is essential for ELZC to prevent degeneration of cochlear.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Li, Yang, Yan, Dong, Peng and Shi.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3389%2ffphar.2021.719267,SFX,

Design(s): 44 subjects undergoing a medico-legal expert assessment for occupational NIHL and fulfilling criteria of reliability were considered. Assessment included: PTA, 40 Hz binaural multiple ASSR and CERA (1-2-3 kHz). Result(s): The respective average difference scores (ASSR - PTA) for 1, 2 and 3 kHz are 13.01 (SD 10.19) dB, 12.72 (SD 8.81) dB and 10.38 (SD 8.19) dB. The average (CERA - ASSR) difference scores are 1.25 (SD 14.63) dB for 1 kHz (NS), 2.73 (SD 13.03) dB for 2 kHz (NS) and 4.51 (SD 12.18) dB for 3 kHz. The correlation between PTA and ASSR (0.82) is significantly stronger than that between PTA and CERA (0.71). In a given subject, PTA thresholds are nearly always lower (i.e., better) than ASSR thresholds, whatever the frequency (1-2-3 kHz) and the side (right - left). A significant negative correlation is found between the difference score (ASSR - PTA) and the degree of hearing loss.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important immune and inflammatory molecules that have been shown to disrupt the disease network of PAND. In a PAND model involving administration of kanamycin combined with furosemide to destroy cochlear hair cells, Tlr 2/4 double knockout (DKO) mice had auditory preservation advantages, which were mainly manifested at 4-16 kHz. DKO mice and wild type (WT) mice had completely damaged cochlear hair cells on the 30th day, but the density of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the Rosenthal canal was significantly higher in the DKO group than in the WT group. The results of immunohistochemistry for p38 and p65 showed that the attenuation of SGN degeneration in DKO mice may not be mediated by canonical Tlr signaling pathways. The SGN transcriptome of DKO and WT mice indicated that there was an inverted gene set enrichment relationship between their different transcriptomes and the SGN degeneration transcriptome, which is consistent with the morphology results. Core module analysis suggested that DKO mice may modulate SGN degeneration by activating two clusters, and the involved molecules include EGF, STAT3, CALB2, LOX, SNAP25, CAV2, SDC4, MYL1, NCS1, PVALB, TPM4, and TMOD4.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Shen, Pan, Chen, Ding, Zou, Zhang, Guo, Ji, Fan, Mei, Hu, Ye and Xiang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3389%2ffcell.2021.750271,SFX,

(Fletcher) Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom",Frontiers Media S.A.,"Cochlear implants (CIs) have been remarkably successful at restoring hearing in severely-to-profoundly hearing-impaired individuals. However, users often struggle to deconstruct complex auditory scenes with multiple simultaneous sounds, which can result in reduced music enjoyment and impaired speech understanding in background noise. Hearing aid users often have similar issues, though these are typically less acute. Several recent studies have shown that haptic stimulation can enhance CI listening by giving access to sound features that are poorly transmitted through the electrical CI signal. This ""electro-haptic stimulation"" improves melody recognition and pitch discrimination, as well as speech-in-noise performance and sound localization. The success of this approach suggests it could also enhance auditory perception in hearing-aid users and other hearing-impaired listeners. This review focuses on the use of haptic stimulation to enhance music perception in hearing-impaired listeners. Music is prevalent throughout everyday life, being critical to media such as film and video games, and often being central to events such as weddings and funerals. It represents the biggest challenge for signal processing, as it is typically an extremely complex acoustic signal, containing multiple simultaneous harmonic and inharmonic sounds. Signal-processing approaches developed for enhancing music perception could therefore have significant utility for other key issues faced by hearing-impaired listeners, such as understanding speech in noisy environments. This review first discusses the limits of music perception in hearing-impaired listeners and the limits of the tactile system. It then discusses the evidence around integration of audio and haptic stimulation in the brain. Next, the features, suitability, and success of current haptic devices for enhancing music perception are reviewed, as well as the signal-processing approaches that could be deployed in future haptic devices. Finally, the cutting-edge technologies that could be exploited for enhancing music perception with haptics are discussed. These include the latest micro motor and driver technology, low-power wireless technology, machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. New approaches for enhancing music perception in hearing-impaired listeners could substantially improve quality of life. Furthermore, effective haptic techniques for providing complex sound information could offer a non-invasive, affordable means for enhancing listening more broadly in hearing-impaired individuals.© Copyright © 2021 Fletcher.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2021.723877,SFX,

The data-driven clustering of subtypes could provide refined characteristics of NIHL, and help identify individuals with typical NIHL at diagnosis. Method(s): This cross-sectional study initially recruited 12,218 occupational noise-exposed employees aged 18-60 years from two factories of a shipyard in Eastern China. Of these, 10,307 subjects with no history of otological injurie or disease, family history of hearing loss, or history of ototoxic drug use were eventually enrolled. All these subjects completed health behavior questionnaires, cumulative noise exposure (CNE) measurement, and pure-tone audiometry. We did data-driven cluster analysis (k-means clustering) in subjects with hearing loss audiograms (n = 6,599) consist of two independent datasets (n = 4,461 and n = 2,138). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to analyze the relevant characteristics of subjects with different audiometric phenotypes compared to those subjects with normal hearing audiograms (n = 3,708). Result(s): A total of 10,307 subjects (9,165 males [88.9%], mean age 34.5 [8.8] years, mean CNE 91.2 [22.7] dB[A]) were included, 3,708 (36.0%) of them had completely normal hearing, the other 6,599 (64.0%) with hearing loss audiograms were clustered into four audiometric phenotypes, which were replicable in two distinct datasets. We named the four clusters as the 4-6 kHz sharp-notched, 4-6 kHz flat-notched, 3-8 kHz notched, and 1-8 kHz notched audiogram. Among them, except for the 4-6 kHz flat-notched audiogram which was not significantly related to NIHL, the other three phenotypes with different relevant characteristics were strongly associated with noise exposure. In particular, the 4-6 kHz sharp-notched audiogram might be a typical subtype of NIHL. Conclusion(s): By data-driven cluster analysis of the large-scale noise-exposed population, we identified three audiometric phenotypes associated with distinct NIHL subtypes. Data-driven sub-stratification of audiograms might eventually contribute to the precise diagnosis and treatment of NIHL.© Copyright © 2021 Wang, Qian, Yang, Shi, Hong, Han, Li, Lin, Huang and Wu.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.3389%2ffmed.2021.662045,SFX,

Karger AG,"Introduction: Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are associated with sensorineural hearing loss. CVD risk factors are known to cluster and interact, thereby increasing the cumulative risk for CVD. Previously, using the database of the Netherlands Longitudinal Study on Hearing (NL-SH), an association was found between a history of smoking and an increased decline in speech recognition in noise over 10 years of follow-up. Prospectively limited data are available on the association between CVD risk factors, interactions of these risk factors, and hearing loss. In this study, data from the NL-SH were used to study the association between CVD risk factors and speech recognition in noise longitudinally. Method(s): Baseline, 5-year, and 10-year follow-up data of the NL-SH were included. The NL-SH is a web-based prospective cohort study which started in 2006. Participants were aged 18-70 years at baseline. Speech recognition in noise was determined with an online digit-triplet speech-in-noise test. In addition, participants completed online questionnaires on demographic, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics. The association of the ability to recognize speech in noise with CVD risk factors (i.e., obesity, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia) was analyzed longitudinally. We also analyzed the interaction between these risk factors (including age, sex, and history of smoking) and speech recognition in noise. Result(s): None of the CVD risk factors or interactions of 2 CVD risk factors was significantly associated with a decline in SRT over time. Obesity (p = 0.016), RA (p = 0.027), and hypertension (p = 0.044) were associated with overall higher (more unfavorable) SRTs. No overall interactions between CVD risk factors were found. Conclusion(s): Obesity, RA, and hypertension were overall associated with a higher SRT, but no longitudinal associations between these or other CVD factors with SRTs were found. Also, no interactions between 2 CVD risk factors and SRTs were found. Although no longitudinal associations between CVD risk factors and decline in SRTs were found, clinicians should be alert about the concurrent association between CVD risk factors and hearing loss.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

(Dotan, Shriki) Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel",Public Library of Science,"Sensory deprivation has long been known to cause hallucinations or ""phantom"" sensations, the most common of which is tinnitus induced by hearing loss, affecting 10-20% of the population. An observable hearing loss, causing auditory sensory deprivation over a band of frequencies, is present in over 90% of people with tinnitus. Existing plasticity-based computational models for tinnitus are usually driven by homeostatic mechanisms, modeled to fit phenomenological findings. Here, we use an objective-driven learning algorithm to model an early auditory processing neuronal network, e.g., in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The learning algorithm maximizes the network's output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model. We show that the connectivity patterns and responses learned by the model display several hallmarks of early auditory neuronal networks. We further demonstrate that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the recurrent network towards its critical point and transition into a tinnitus-like state. In this state, the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation, namely, it ""hallucinates"" auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how objective-driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the network's input representation can also elicit pathologies such as tinnitus as a result of sensory deprivation.Copyright © 2021 Dotan, Shriki.

This study aimed to empirically test a pharmacokinetic (PK) model using Bayesian estimation of drug exposure in the deeper body tissues to determine feasibility for prediction of ototoxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): IV doses (n=3645) of tobramycin and vancomycin were documented with precise timing from 38 patients with CF (aged 8-21 years), including total doses given and total exposure (cumulative AUC). Concentration results were obtained at 3 and 10 h for the central (C1) compartment. These variables were used in Bayesian estimation to predict trough levels in the secondary tissue compartments (C2 trough) and maximum concentrations (C2max). The C1 and C2 measures were then correlated with hearing levels in the extended high-frequency range. Result(s): Patients with more severe hearing loss were older and had a higher number of tobramycin C2max concentrations >2 mg/L than patients with normal or lesser degrees of hearing loss. These two factors together significantly predicted average high-frequency hearing level (r=0.618, P<0.001). Traditional metrics such as C1 trough concentrations were not predictive. The relative risk for hearing loss was 5.8 times greater with six or more tobramycin courses that exceeded C2max concentrations of 3 mg/L or higher, with sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 86%. Conclusion(s): Advanced PK model-informed analysis predicted ototoxicity risk in patients with CF treated with tobramycin and demonstrated high test prediction.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

To distinguish between the effects of sensorineural hearing loss and aging on cortical processing, the main goal of the present study was to compare cortical responses using the same stimulus paradigms and recording conditions in two strains of mice (C57BL/6J and FVB) that differ in the degree of age-related hearing loss. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained from freely moving young and old mice using epidural screw electrodes. We measured event related potentials (ERP) and 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR). We used a novel stimulus, termed the gap-ASSR stimulus, which elicits an ASSR by rapidly presenting short gaps in continuous noise. By varying the gap widths and modulation depths, we probed the limits of temporal processing in young and old mice. Temporal fidelity of ASSR and gap-ASSR responses were measured as phase consistency across trials (inter-trial phase clustering; ITPC). The old C57 mice, which show severe hearing loss, produced larger ERP amplitudes compared to young mice. Despite robust ERPs, the old C57 mice showed significantly diminished ITPC in the ASSR and gap-ASSR responses, even with 100% modulation depth. The FVB mice, which show mild hearing loss with age, generated similar ERP amplitudes and ASSR ITPC across the age groups tested. However, the old FVB mice showed decreased gap-ASSR responses compared to young mice, particularly for modulation depths <100%. The C57 mice data suggest that severe presbycusis leads to increased gain in the auditory cortex, but with reduced temporal fidelity. The FVB mice data suggest that with mild hearing loss, age-related changes in temporal processing become apparent only when tested with more challenging sounds (shorter gaps and shallower modulation).Copyright © 2021",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2021.108380,SFX,34758398 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34758398]

Speech perception in cocktail party scenarios has been the concern of a group of researchers who are involved with the design of hearing-aid devices. Approach. In this paper, a new unified ear-EEG-based binaural speech enhancement system is introduced for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners. The proposed model, which is based on auditory attention detection (AAD) and individual hearing threshold (HT) characteristics, has four main processing stages. In the binaural processing stage, a system based on the deep neural network is trained to estimate auditory ratio masks for each of the speakers in the mixture signal. In the EEG processing stage, AAD is employed to select one ratio mask corresponding to the attended speech. Here, the same EEG data is also used to predict the HTs of listeners who participated in the EEG recordings. The third stage, called insertion gain computation, concerns the calculation of a special amplification gain based on individual HTs. Finally, in the selection-resynthesis-amplification stage, the attended speech signals of the target are resynthesized based on the selected auditory mask and then are amplified using the computed insertion gain. Main results. The detection of the attended speech and the HTs are achieved by classifiers that are trained with features extracted from the scalp EEG or the ear EEG signals. The results of evaluating AAD and HT detection show high detection accuracies. The systematic evaluations of the proposed system yield substantial intelligibility and quality improvements for the HI and normal-hearingaudiograms. Significance.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of co-occurring conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, along with other conditions that affect the blood vessels. Components of MetS include insulin resistance, body weight, lipid concentration, blood pressure, and blood glucose concentration, as well as other features of insulin resistance such as microalbuminuria. MetS has become a major public health problem affecting 20-30% of the global population. This study utilized health examination to investigate whether metabolic syndrome was related to hearing loss. Method(s): A total of 94,223 people who underwent health check-ups, including hearing tests, from January 2010 to December 2020 were evaluated. Subjects were divided into two groups, with and without metabolic syndrome. In addition, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane libraries were systematically searched, using keywords such as ""hearing loss"" and ""metabolic syndrome"", for studies that evaluated the relationship between the two. Result(s): Of the 94,223 subjects, 11,414 (12.1%) had metabolic syndrome and 82,809 did not. The mean ages of subjects in the two groups were 46.1 and 43.9 years, respectively. A comparison of hearing thresholds by age in subjects with and without metabolic syndrome showed that the average pure tone hearing thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome than in subjects without it in all age groups. (p < 0.001) Rates of hearing loss in subjects with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the components of metabolic syndrome were 7.9%, 12.1%, 13.8%, 13.8%, 15.5% and 16.3%, respectively, indicating a significant association between the number of components of metabolic syndrome and the rate of hearing loss (p < 0.0001). The odds ratio of hearing loss was significantly higher in subjects with four components of metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, blood pressure, and triglyceride and fasting blood sugar concentrations (p < 0.0001). (4) Conclusion(s): The number of components of the metabolic syndrome is positively correlated with the rate of sensorineural hearing loss.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

However, data are scarce, especially on adult populations, and a possible involvement of the central auditory areas has not been investigated yet. We performed a multicenter cross-sectional audiological and single-center 3Tesla brain perfusion MRI study enrolling 77 transfusion-dependent/non transfusion-dependent adult patients and 56 healthy controls. Pure tone audiometry, demographics, clinical/laboratory and cognitive functioning data were recorded. Result(s): Half of patients (52%) presented with high-frequency hearing deficit, with overt hypoacusia (Pure Tone Average (PTA) > 25 dB) in 35%, irrespective of iron chelation or clinical phenotype. Bilateral voxel clusters of significant relative hypoperfusion were found in the auditory cortex of beta-thalassemia patients, regardless of clinical phenotype. In controls and transfusion-dependent (but not in non-transfusion-dependent) patients, the relative auditory cortex perfusion values increased linearly with age (p < 0.04). Relative auditory cortex perfusion values showed a significant U-shaped correlation with PTA values among hearing loss patients, and a linear correlation with the full scale intelligence quotient (right side p = 0.01, left side p = 0.02) with its domain related to communication skills (right side p = 0.04, left side p = 0.07) in controls but not in beta-thalassemia patients. Audiometric test results did not correlate to cognitive test scores in any subgroup. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, primary auditory cortex perfusion changes are a metabolic hallmark of adult beta-thalassemia, thus suggesting complex remodeling of the hearing function, that occurs regardless of chelation therapy and before clinically manifest hearing loss. The cognitive impact of perfusion changes is intriguing but requires further investigations.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1186%2fs13023-021-01969-0,SFX,34353346 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34353346]

Outputs were compared with quantitative data from the consumer reviews (short response questions exploring hearing aid performance and benefit, and some meta-data such as hearing aid brand and years of hearing aid ownership). STUDY SAMPLE: 1378 online consumer hearing aid reviews. RESULT(S): Six clusters within two domains were identified. The domain Device Acquisition included three clusters: Finding the right provider, device and price-point; Selecting a hearing aid to suit the hearing loss; Attaining physical fit and device management skills. The domain Device Use included three clusters: Smartphone streaming to hearing aids; Hearing aid adjustment using smartphone; and Hearing in noise.

DESIGN: A questionnaire containing nine domains: demography, administration, existing screening, coverage, tests, diagnosis, treatment, cost and adverse effects, was presented to hearing screening experts. Responses were verified. Clusters were identified based on number of screening steps and use of OAE or aABR, either for all infants or for well and high-risk infants (dual-protocol). STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-two experts completed the questionnaire sufficiently: 40 European countries, Russia, Malawi, Rwanda, India and China. RESULT(S): It took considerable effort to find experts for all countries with sufficient time and knowledge. Data essential for evaluation are often not collected. Infants are first screened in maternity wards in most countries. Human development index and health expenditure were high among countries with dual protocols, three screening steps, including aABR, and low among countries without NHS and countries using OAE for all infants.

The conditions were: no processing (NP); processing using the RNN; and processing using a multi-channel transient reduction method (MCTR). Ten participants with normal hearing and ten with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated. For the latter, frequency-dependent linear amplification was applied to all stimuli to compensate for individual audibility losses. For the normal-hearing participants, processing using the RNN was significantly preferred over that for NP for subjective intelligibility and comfort, processing using the RNN was significantly preferred over that for MCTR for subjective intelligibility, and processing using the MCTR was significantly preferred over that for NP for comfort for the higher transient level only.

Misalignment of the auditory neural impairment may impose challenges in processing incoming auditory stimulus that can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The electrophysiological behaviour response emanated from EEG auditory evoked potential (AEP) requires highly trained professionals for analysis and interpretation. Reliable automated methods using techniques of machine learning would assist the auditory assessment process for informed treatment and practice. It is thus highly required to develop models that are more efficient and precise by considering the characteristics of brain signals. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of several state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning that adopt EEG evoked response for the auditory assessment within the last 13 years.

Method(s): The Swedish LifeGene cohort was used to sample cross-sectional survey data (collected 2009-2016) of 7615 participants with tinnitus, 697 (9.2%) of whom rated their tinnitus as bothersome. Associations between bothersome tinnitus and subjective hearing ability, physical and mental comorbidities were investigated by separate age- and gender-adjusted multiple logistic regression models. Interrelationships between these associations were investigated by logistic mediation models. Result(s): Compared to non-bothersome tinnitus, bothersome tinnitus was associated with higher age, reduced subjective hearing ability, hearing-related difficulties in social situations, cardiovascular disease, chronic shoulder pain, thyroid disease, Meniere's disease, depression, anxiety syndrome, and social anxiety. Subjective hearing impairment or hearing-related difficulties mediated 13-36% of the effects of mental comorbidities on bothersome tinnitus. Depression or anxiety syndrome mediated 5-8% of most relationships between physical comorbidities and bothersome tinnitus. Depression, anxiety syndrome, or social anxiety mediated 2-4% of the effects of subjective hearing impairment or hearing-related difficulties on bothersome tinnitus. Conclusion(s): Psychological factors, subjective hearing impairment, and hearing-related difficulties in social situations play key roles in predicting bothersome (vs. non-bothersome) tinnitus in a large population sample. Psychological factors contribute to explaining the impact of physical comorbidities and hearing-related effects on bothersome tinnitus.

Based on previous studies, we know that distress is encoded by changes in functional connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions. However, how distress relates to large-scale brain networks is not yet clear. In the current study, we investigate the relationship between distress and the efficiency of a network by examining its topological properties using resting state fMRI collected from 90 chronic tinnitus patients. The present results indicate that distress negatively correlates with path length and positively correlates with clustering coefficient, small-worldness, and efficiency of information transfer. Specifically, path analysis showed that the relationship between distress and efficiency is significantly mediated by the resilience of the feeder connections and the centrality of the rich-club connections. In other words, the higher the network efficiency, the lower the resilience of the feeder connections and the centrality of the rich-club connections, which in turn reflects in higher distress in tinnitus patients. This indicates a reorganization of the network towards a paradoxically more efficient topology in patients with high distress, potentially explaining their increased rumination on the tinnitus percept itself.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fbs.pbr.2020.08.007,SFX,33637228 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33637228]

This study applied machine learning methods to develop a new ISSHL prognosis prediction model. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed the medical data of 244 patients who underwent combined intratympanic and systemic steroid treatment for ISSHL at a tertiary referral center between January 2015 and October 2019. We used 35 variables to predict hearing recovery based on Siegel's criteria. In addition to performing an analysis based on the conventional logistic regression model, we developed prediction models with five machine learning methods: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, decision tree, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and boosting. To compare the predictive ability of each model, the accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC) were calculated. Result(s): Former otological history, ear fullness, delay between symptom onset and treatment, delay between symptom onset and intratympanic steroid injection (ITSI), and initial hearing thresholds of the affected and unaffected ears differed significantly between the recovery and non-recovery groups. While the RF method (accuracy: 72.22%, ROC-AUC: 0.7445) achieved the highest predictive power, the other methods also featured relatively good predictive power. In the RF model, the following variables were identified to be important for hearing-recovery prediction: delay between symptom onset and ITSI or the initial treatment, initial hearing levels of the affected and non-affected ears, body mass index, and a previous history of hearing loss. Conclusion(s): The machine learning models predictive of hearing recovery following treatment for ISSHL showed superior predictive power relative to the conventional logistic regression method, potentially allowing for better patient treatment outcomes.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.amjoto.2020.102858,SFX,33445040 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33445040]

The functional changes occurring at these synapses during aging are not fully understood. Here, we characterized this aging process in IHCs of C57BL/6J mice, a strain which is known to carry a cadherin-23 mutation and experiences early hearing loss with age. These mice, while displaying a large increase in auditory brainstem thresholds due to 50% loss of IHC synaptic ribbons at middle age (postnatal day 365), paradoxically showed enhanced acoustic startle reflex suggesting a hyperacusis-like response. The auditory defect was associated with a large shrinkage of the IHCs' cell body and a drastic enlargement of their remaining presynaptic ribbons which were facing enlarged postsynaptic AMPAR clusters. Presynaptic Ca2+ microdomains and the capacity of IHCs to sustain high rates of exocytosis were largely increased, while on the contrary the expression of the fast-repolarizing BK channels, known to negatively control transmitter release, was decreased. This age-related synaptic plasticity in IHCs suggested a functional potentiation of synaptic transmission at the surviving synapses, a process that could partially compensate the decrease in synapse number and underlie hyperacusis.© Copyright © 2021 Peineau, Belleudy, Pietropaolo, Bouleau and Dulon.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffnagi.2021.756449,SFX,

The causative gene deafness/dystonia protein 1 (DDP1)/translocase of the inner membrane 8A (TIMM8A) encodes a mitochondrial intermembrane space chaperon. The molecular mechanism of DDON remains unclear, and detailed information on animal models has not been reported yet. Methods and results We characterized a family with DDON syndrome, in which the affected members carried a novel hemizygous variation in the DDP1 gene (NM_004085.3, c.82C>T, p.Q28X). We then generated a mouse line with the hemizygous mutation (p.I23fs49X) in the Timm8a1 gene using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats /Cas9 technology. The deficient DDP1 protein was confirmed by western blot assay. Electron microscopic analysis of brain samples from the mutant mice indicated abnormal mitochondrial structure in several brain areas. However, Timm8a1 I23fs49X/y mutation did not affect the import of mitochondria inner member protein Tim23 and outer member protein Tom40 as well as the biogenesis of the proteins in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system and the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD / SOD-2). The male mice with Timm8a1 I23fs49X/y mutant exhibited less weight gain, hearing impairment and cognitive deficit. Conclusion Our study suggests that frameshift mutation of the Timm8a1 gene in mice leads to an abnormal mitochondrial structure in the brain, correlating with hearing and memory impairment. Taken together, we have successfully generated a mouse model bearing loss-of-function mutation in Timm8a1.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Here, we investigate the central auditory correlates of HL in people with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test their association with genetic markers with the aim of revealing pathogenic mechanisms. Method(s): Brain glucose metabolism based on FDG-PET, self-reported HL status, and genetic data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. FDG-PET data was analysed from 742 control subjects (non-HL with normal cognition or MCI) and 162 cases (HL with normal cognition or MCI) with age ranges of 72.2 +/- 7.1 and 77.4 +/- 6.4, respectively. Voxel-wise statistics of FDG uptake differences between cases and controls were computed using the generalised linear model in SPM12. An additional 1515 FDG-PET scans of 618 participants were analysed using linear mixed effect models to assess longitudinal HL effects. Furthermore, a quantitative trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on the glucose uptake within regions of interest (ROIs), which were defined by the voxel-wise comparison, using genotyping data with 5,082,878 variants available for HL cases and HL controls (N = 817). Result(s): The HL group exhibited hypometabolism in the bilateral Heschl's gyrus (kleft = 323; kright = 151; Tleft = 4.55; Tright = 4.14; peak Puncorr < 0.001), the inferior colliculus (k = 219;T = 3.53; peak Puncorr < 0.001) and cochlear nucleus (k = 18;T = 3.55; peak Puncorr < 0.001) after age correction and using a cluster forming height threshold P < 0.005 (FWE-uncorrected). Moreover, in an age-matched subset, the cluster comprising the left Heschl's gyrus survived the FWE-correction (kleft = 1903; Tleft = 4.39; cluster PFWE-corr = 0.001). The quantitative trait GWAS identified no genome-wide significant locus in the three HL ROIs. However, various loci were associated at the suggestive threshold (p < 1e-05). Conclusion(s): Compared to the non-HL group, glucose metabolism in the HL group was lower in the auditory cortex, the inferior colliculus, and the cochlear nucleus although the effect sizes were small. The GWAS identified candidate genes that might influence FDG uptake in these regions. However, the specific biological pathway(s) underlying the role of these genes in FDG-hypometabolism in the auditory pathway requires further investigation.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.nicl.2021.102823,SFX,34624637 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34624637]

(Buck, Schnupp) City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China",Elsevier B.V.,"For deaf patients cochlear implants (CIs) can restore substantial amounts of functional hearing. However, binaural hearing, and in particular, the perception of interaural time differences (ITDs) with current CIs has been found to be notoriously poor, especially in the event of early hearing loss. One popular hypothesis for these deficits posits that a lack of early binaural experience may be a principal cause of poor ITD perception in pre-lingually deaf CI patients. This is supported by previous electrophysiological studies done in neonatally deafened, bilateral CI-stimulated animals showing reduced ITD sensitivity. However, we have recently demonstrated that neonatally deafened CI rats can quickly learn to discriminate microsecond ITDs under optimized stimulation conditions which suggests that the inability of human CI users to make use of ITDs is not due to lack of binaural hearing experience during development. In the study presented here, we characterized ITD sensitivity and tuning of inferior colliculus neurons under bilateral CI stimulation of neonatally deafened and hearing experienced rats. The hearing experienced rats were not deafened prior to implantation. Both cohorts were implanted bilaterally between postnatal days 64-77 and recorded immediately following surgery. Both groups showed comparably large proportions of ITD sensitive multi-units in the inferior colliculus (Deaf: 84.8%, Hearing: 82.5%), and the strength of ITD tuning, quantified as mutual information between response and stimulus ITD, was independent of hearing experience. However, the shapes of tuning curves differed substantially between both groups. We observed four main clusters of tuning curves - trough, contralateral, central, and ipsilateral tuning. Interestingly, over 90% of multi-units for hearing experienced rats showed predominantly contralateral tuning, whereas as many as 50% of multi-units in neonatally deafened rats were centrally tuned. However, when we computed neural d' scores to predict likely limits on performance in sound lateralization tasks, we did not find that these differences in tuning shapes predicted worse psychoacoustic performance for the neonatally deafened animals. We conclude that, at least in rats, substantial amounts of highly precise, ""innate"" ITD sensitivity can be found even after profound hearing loss throughout infancy. However, ITD tuning curve shapes appear to be strongly influenced by auditory experience although substantial lateralization encoding is present even in its absence.Copyright © 2021",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2021.108305,SFX,34315027 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34315027]

To mimic this human hearing ability for people with hearing loss, scientists integrate beamforming algorithms into the signal processing path of hearing aids or implants' audio processors. Although these algorithms' performance strongly depends on the number and spatial arrangement of the microphones, most devices are equipped with a small number of microphones mounted close to each other on the audio processor housing. We measured and evaluated the impact of the number and spatial arrangement of hearing aid or head-mounted microphones on the performance of the established Minimum Variance Distortionless Response beamformer in cocktail party scenarios. The measurements revealed that the optimal microphone placement exploits monaural cues (pinna-effect), is close to the target signal, and creates a large distance spread due to its spatial arrangement. However, this microphone placement is impractical for hearing aid or implant users, as it includes microphone positions such as on the forehead. To overcome microphones' placement at impractical positions, we propose a deep virtual sensing estimation of the corresponding audio signals. The results of objective measures and a subjective listening test with 20 participants showed that the virtually sensed microphone signals significantly improved the speech quality, especially in cocktail party scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios. Subjective speech quality was assessed using a 3-alternative forced choice procedure to determine which of the presented speech mixtures was most pleasant to understand. Hearing aid and cochlear implant (CI) users might benefit from the presented approach using virtually sensed microphone signals, especially in noisy environments.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2021.108294,SFX,34182232 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34182232]

Although tinnitus is closely associated with peripheral hearing loss (HL), it remains unclear why only some individuals with HL develop tinnitus. In this study, we investigated the differences between 65 HL with tinnitus (HL-T) and 104 HL with no tinnitus (HL-NT) using a resting-state electroencephalography data-based volume entropy model of the brain network, by comparing the afferent node capacities, that quantify the contribution of each node to the spread of information, of all Brodmann areas. While the HL-T group showed increased information flow in areas involved in Bayesian inference (the left orbitofrontal cortex, the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and auditory memory storage (the right hippocampus/parahippocampus), the HL-NT group showed increased afferent node capacity in hub areas of the default mode network (DMN; the right posterior cingulate cortex and the right medial temporal gyrus). These results suggest that the balance of activity between the Bayesian inferential network (updating missing auditory information by retrieving auditory memories from the hippocampus/parahippocampus) and DMN (maintaining the ""silent status quo"") determines whether phantom auditory perception occurs in a brain with decreased peripheral auditory input.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Identifying tinnitus subtypes might help to establish individualized diagnosis and therapies. The minimum masking level (MML) is a clinical tool defined as the minimum intensity of a masking sound required to cover tinnitus. Understanding the differences among masking patterns in patients could facilitate the task of subtyping tinnitus. Here, we studied the variability of hearing thresholds and MMLs among patients with tinnitus to identify tinnitus subgroups. A population of 366 consecutive patients from a specialized tinnitus clinic were included in the analysis. Hearing thresholds and MMLs were determined for octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz, as well as for 3 and 6 kHz. Subjects were divided into two groups according to whether their tinnitus was maskable (M, 329 subjects) or non-maskable (NM, 37 subjects). Hearing thresholds and tinnitus loudness did not differ significantly between both groups. The dimensionality of the data was reduced by means of principal component analysis (PCA), and the largest resulting components were used for clustering the data. The cluster analysis resulted in five clusters with differences in tinnitus pitch, lateralization, hearing thresholds and MML, as well as on age and gender. Clusters differed in contours of hearing thresholds and MML, describing patterns of low or high thresholds in combination with low or high MML. The clustering solution presented a low silhouette value (0.45), implying that the clustering is weak and could be artificial. The analysis pointed out the diversity across tinnitus patients. Our results suggest that there might be a continuum of patients' characteristics rather than discrete subgroups.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fbs.pbr.2021.04.011,SFX,34243892 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34243892]

Although the multisensory interactions derived from this combination of information and that shape auditory function are seen across all sensory modalities, our greatest body of knowledge to date centers on how vision influences audition. In this review, we attempt to capture the state of our understanding at this point in time regarding this topic. Following a general introduction, the review is divided into 5 sections. In the first section, we review the psychophysical evidence in humans regarding vision's influence in audition, making the distinction between vision's ability to enhance versus alter auditory performance and perception. Three examples are then described that serve to highlight vision's ability to modulate auditory processes: spatial ventriloquism, cross-modal dynamic capture, and the McGurk effect. The final part of this section discusses models that have been built based on available psychophysical data and that seek to provide greater mechanistic insights into how vision can impact audition. The second section reviews the extant neuroimaging and far-field imaging work on this topic, with a strong emphasis on the roles of feedforward and feedback processes, on imaging insights into the causal nature of audiovisual interactions, and on the limitations of current imaging-based approaches. These limitations point to a greater need for machine-learning-based decoding approaches toward understanding how auditory representations are shaped by vision. The third section reviews the wealth of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological data from animal models that highlights audiovisual interactions at the neuronal and circuit level in both subcortical and cortical structures. It also speaks to the functional significance of audiovisual interactions for two critically important facets of auditory perception-scene analysis and communication. The fourth section presents current evidence for alterations in audiovisual processes in three clinical conditions: autism, schizophrenia, and sensorineural hearing loss. These changes in audiovisual interactions are postulated to have cascading effects on higher-order domains of dysfunction in these conditions. The final section highlights ongoing work seeking to leverage our knowledge of audiovisual interactions to develop better remediation approaches to these sensory-based disorders, founded in concepts of perceptual plasticity in which vision has been shown to have the capacity to facilitate auditory learning.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1007%2fs10162-021-00789-0,SFX,34014416 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34014416]

The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the etiology of tinnitus are still under exploration. Electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies provide increasing evidence for abnormal functioning in auditory but also in non-auditory, e.g., emotional, brain areas. In order to elucidate alterations of affective processing in patients with chronic tinnitus, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses to emotionally expressive and neutral faces. Twelve patients with chronic tinnitus and a group of 11 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, hearing loss and depressive symptoms were investigated. While viewing emotionally expressive faces compared to neutral faces brain activations in the tinnitus patients differed from those of the controls in a cluster that encompasses the amygdala, the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally. Whereas in controls affective faces induced higher brain activation in these regions than neutral faces, these regions in tinnitus patients were deactivated. Our results (1) provide evidence for alterations of affective processing of facial expressions in tinnitus patients indicating general domain-unspecific dysfunctions in emotion processing and (2) indicate the involvement of medial temporal areas in the pathophysiology of tinnitus.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fbs.pbr.2021.01.026,SFX,33931179 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33931179]

The objectives of this study are to identify and characterize psychopathology in MD and to find risk factors for an increased rate and intensity of crisis and chronic symptoms. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a transversal study in all patients diagnosed with definite MD in our department during a 5-year period. Sample subjects were interviewed in 3 steps: first, an otorhinolaryngologist collected information about clinical and pharmacological background of MD; second, a psychiatrist screened for mood, anxiety and personality disorders; in a third stage, the patient completed the DHI (Dizziness Handicap Inventory), STAI-Y (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), NEO-PI-R (Neo Personality Inventory Reviewed) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for vertigo and dizziness. Statistical analysis was performed to search for risk factors for multiple and intense crisis and chronic symptoms. Result(s): Thirty-four patients completed all 3 phases of the study. A predominant dysfunctional personality trait was identified in 80% of patients (predominantly cluster C type), 35% were being treated with psychiatric medication and 34.4% had a considerable mood or anxiety disorder. All patients scored high (>7) in VAS during crisis. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between crisis rate and STAI, anxiety-subscale (N1) in NEO-PI-R, VAS and DHI scores (p<.044). Crises were more common in bilateral MD (p=.041). DHI scores were higher with higher STAI and N1 (p=.001). Disease duration and pure tone average were found to have a positive moderate correlation (p=.017). Conclusion(s): The positive correlations between crisis rate, chronic dizziness and anxiety-related personality traits reveal a bidirectional and intimate relationship between personality, anxiety and MD, affecting these patients' quality of life. These results support the relevance of prospecting adjuvant psychological and psychiatric approaches to these patients.Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinolaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.otorri.2020.06.007,SFX,33059851 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33059851]

Difficulty understanding speech in noise is one of the primary reasons people seek hearing assistance. Despite amplification, many hearing aid users still struggle to understand speech in noise. In response to this persistent problem, hearing aid manufacturers have invested significantly in developing new solutions. Any solution is not without its tradeoffs, and decisions must be made when optimizing and implementing them. Much of this happens behind the scenes, and casual observers fail to appreciate the nuances of developing new hearing aid technologies. The difficulty of communicating this information to clinicians may hinder the use or the fine-tuning of the various technologies available today. The purpose of this issue of Seminars in Hearing is to educate professionals and students in audiology, hearing science, and engineering about different approaches to combat problems related to environmental and wind noise using technologies that include classification, directional microphones, binaural signal processing, beamformers, motion sensors, and machine learning. To accomplish this purpose, some of the top researchers and engineers from the world's largest hearing aid manufacturers agreed to share their unique insights.Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

Glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 2 (GRXCR2) is localized at the base of stereocilia and is necessary for stereocilia morphogenesis and auditory perception. However, the detailed functions of GRXCR2 in hair cells are still largely unknown. Here, we report that GRXCR2 interacts with chloride intracellular channel protein 5 (CLIC5) which is also localized at the base of stereocilia and required for normal hearing in human and mouse. Immunolocalization analyses suggest that GRXCR2 is not required for the localization of CLIC5 to the stereociliary base during development, or vice versa. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, we deleted 60 amino acids near the N-terminus of GRXCR2 essential for its interaction with CLIC5. Interestingly, mice harboring this in-frame deletion in Grxcr2 exhibit moderate hearing loss at lower frequencies and severe hearing loss at higher frequencies although the morphogenesis of stereocilia is minimally affected. Thus, our findings reveal that the interaction between GRXCR2 and CLIC5 is crucial for normal hearing.© Copyright © 2021 Li, Liu and Zhao.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffcell.2021.671364,SFX,

How speech is coded and influenced by various conditions is not known. It is also uncertain whether human nerve signaling involves exclusive proteins and gene manifestations compared with that of other species. Such information is difficult to determine due to the vulnerable, ""esoteric,"" and encapsulated human ear surrounded by the hardest bone in the body. We collected human inner ear material for nanoscale visualization combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM), super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), and RNA-scope analysis for the first time. Our aim was to gain information about the molecular instruments in human auditory nerve processing and deviations, and ways to perform electric modeling of prosthetic devices. Material(s) and Method(s): Human tissue was collected during trans-cochlear procedures to remove petro-clival meningioma after ethical permission. Cochlear neurons were processed for electron microscopy, confocal microscopy (CM), SR-SIM, and high-sensitive in situ hybridization for labeling single mRNA transcripts to detect ion channel and transporter proteins associated with nerve signal initiation and conductance. Result(s): Transport proteins and RNA transcripts were localized at the subcellular level. Hemi-nodal proteins were identified beneath the inner hair cells (IHCs). Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) were expressed in the spiral ganglion (SG) and axonal initial segments (AISs). Nodes of Ranvier (NR) expressed Nav1.6 proteins, and encoding genes critical for inter-cellular coupling were disclosed. Discussion(s): Our results suggest that initial spike generators are located beneath the IHCs in humans. The first NRs appear at different places. Additional spike generators and transcellular communication may boost, sharpen, and synchronize afferent signals by cell clusters at different frequency bands. These instruments may be essential for the filtering of complex sounds and may be challenged by various pathological conditions.© Copyright © 2021 Liu, Luque, Li, Schrott-Fischer, Glueckert, Tylstedt, Rajan, Ladak, Agrawal and Rask-Andersen.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffncel.2021.642211,SFX,

First, we identify lesion-specific deficits for the encoding of short timescale spectro-temporal non-speech and speech properties in patients with left posterior temporal cortex stroke. Second, using lesion-guided probabilistic tractography in healthy participants, we revealed bidirectional temporo-cerebellar connectivity with cerebellar dentate nuclei and crura I/II.

Most sensorineural hearing loss is caused by the loss of mechanosensitive hair cells in the cochlea, often due to aging, noise, and ototoxic drugs. The identification of genes that can be targeted to slow aging and reduce the vulnerability of hair cells to insults is critical for the prevention of sensorineural hearing loss. Our previous cell-specific transcriptome analysis of adult cochlear hair cells and supporting cells showed that Clu, encoding a secreted chaperone that is involved in several basic biological events, such as cell death, tumor progression, and neurodegenerative disorders, is expressed in hair cells and supporting cells. We generated Clu-null mice (C57BL/6) to investigate its role in the organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium responsible for hearing in the mammalian cochlea. We showed that the deletion of Clu did not affect the development of hair cells and supporting cells; hair cells and supporting cells appeared normal at 1 month of age. Auditory function tests showed that Clu-null mice had hearing thresholds comparable to those of wild-type littermates before 3 months of age. Interestingly, Clu-null mice displayed less hair cell and hearing loss compared to their wildtype littermates after 3 months. Furthermore, the deletion of Clu is protected against aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss in both in vivo and in vitro models. Our findings suggested that the inhibition of Clu expression could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the alleviation of age-related and ototoxic drug-induced hearing loss.Copyright © 2021 Xiaochang Zhao et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1155%2f2021%2f9979157,SFX,34194490 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34194490]

At an early age in mice, inner hair cells receive efferent feedback, which helps fine-tune tonotopic maps in the brainstem. In adulthood, inner hair cell efferent innervation wanes but increases again in older animals. It is not clear, however, whether age-related inner hair cell efferents increase along the entire range of the cochlear frequencies, or if this increase is restricted to a particular frequency-region, and whether this phenomenon occurs in both sexes. Age-related hearing loss, presbycusis, affects men and women differently. In mice, this difference is also strain specific. In aging black six mice, the auditory brainstem response thresholds increase in females earlier than in males. Here, we study age-related increase of the inner hair cell efferent innervation throughout the cochlea before hearing onset, in one month old and in ten months old and older male and female black six mice. We collected confocal images of immunostained inner hair cell efferents and quantified the labeled terminals in the entire cochlea using a machine learning algorithm. The overall number of the inner hair cell efferents in both sexes did not change significantly between age-groups. The distribution of the inner hair cell efferent innervation did not differ across frequencies in the cochlea. However, in females, inner hair cells received on average up to four times more efferent innervation than in males per each of the frequency regions tested. Sex differences were also found in the oldest age-group tested (>= 10 months) where on average inner hair cells received six times more efferents in females than in males of matching age. Our findings emphasize the importance of including both sexes in sensorineural hearing loss research.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2021.108215,SFX,33677192 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33677192]

(Wang) GE Healthcare, Shanghai, China",Frontiers Media S.A.,"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a sudden-onset hearing impairment that rapidly develops within 72 h and is mostly unilateral. Only a few patients can be identified with a defined cause by routine clinical examinations. Recently, some studies have shown that unilateral SSNHL is associated with alterations in the central nervous system. However, little is known about the topological organization of white matter (WM) networks in unilateral SSNHL patients in the acute phase. In this study, 145 patients with SSNHL and 91 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and graph theoretical approaches. The topological properties of WM networks, including global and nodal parameters, were investigated. At the global level, SSNHL patients displayed decreased clustering coefficient, local efficiency, global efficiency, normalized clustering coefficient, normalized characteristic path length, and small-worldness and increased characteristic path length (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. At the nodal level, altered nodal centralities in brain regions involved the auditory network, visual network, attention network, default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network, and subcortical network (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). These findings indicate a shift of the WM network topology in SSNHL patients toward randomization, which is characterized by decreased global network integration and segregation and is reflected by decreased global connectivity and altered nodal centralities. This study could help us understand the potential pathophysiology of unilateral SSNHL.© Copyright © 2021 Zou, Ma, Liu, Li, Liu, Wang, Wang, Fan and Han.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2021.666651,SFX,

To gain further insight into the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) within the central auditory system, we investigated constitutive Mir-183/96dko mice of both sexes. In this mouse model, the genomically clustered miR-183 and miR-96 are constitutively deleted. It shows significantly and specifically reduced volumes of auditory hindbrain nuclei, because of decreases in cell number and soma size. Electrophysiological analysis of the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) demonstrated strongly altered synaptic transmission in young-adult mice. We observed an increase in quantal content and readily releasable vesicle pool size in the presynapse while the overall morphology of the calyx was unchanged. Detailed analysis of the active zones (AZs) revealed differences in its molecular composition and synaptic vesicle (SV) distribution. Postsynaptically, altered clustering and increased synaptic abundancy of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 was observed resulting in an increase in quantal amplitude. Together, these presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations led to a 2-fold increase of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in MNTB neurons. None of these changes were observed in deaf Cldn14ko mice, confirming an on-site role of miR-183 and miR-96 in the auditory hindbrain. Our data suggest that the Mir-183/96 cluster plays a key role for proper synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held and for the development of the auditory hindbrain.Copyright © 2021 the authors",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1523%2fJNEUROSCI.0139-20.2021,SFX,34193555 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34193555]

Inclusion criteria were BAER performed at 4-10 weeks of age, testing of complete litters and available phenotypic data. The age, sex, coat and iris colour, presence and location of face and body patches, hearing status and BAER- determined parental hearing status of each puppy were recorded. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to determine whether any of these variables were significantly associated with CSD, while adjusting for clustering at litter level. Inclusion criteria were met for 524 puppies. Hearing was bilaterally normal in 464 puppies (88.6%). The prevalence of unilateral and bilateral CSD was 9.7% and 1.7%, respectively. On the basis of multivariable analysis, the presence of a pigmented face patch was the only phenotypic variable significantly associated with CSD, and was linked to a reduced risk of the condition. The prevalence was similar to that reported in an Australian population of ACDs. The key findings from this study were that overall CSD prevalence in the ACD population in the UK was 11.4%, and puppies with a face patch were at reduced risk of the condition.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.tvjl.2021.105711,SFX,34182072 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=34182072]

Method(s): Five features (age, sex, cumulative noise exposure [CNE], smoking, and alcohol drinking status) of 5,539 shipbuilding workers from large cross-sectional surveys were included in four ML classification models to predict their hearing levels. The area under the curve (AUC) and prediction accuracy were exploited to evaluate the performance of the models. Based on the prediction error of the ML models, the NIHL-susceptible group (n=150) and NIHL-resistant group (n=150) with a paradoxical relationship between hearing levels and features were separately screened, to identify the underlying variants associated with NIHL risk using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, candidate risk variants were validated in an additional replication cohort (n=2108), followed by a meta-analysis. Result(s): With 10-fold cross-validation, the performances of the four ML models were robust and similar, with average AUCs and accuracies ranging from 0.783 to 0.798 and 73.7% to 73.8%, respectively. The phenotypes of the NIHL-susceptible and NIHL-resistant groups were significantly different (all p<0.001). After WES analysis and filtering, 12 risk variants contributing to NIHL susceptibility were identified and replicated. The meta-analyses showed that the A allele of CDH23 rs41281334 (odds ratio [OR]=1.506, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.106-2.051) and the C allele of WHRN rs12339210 (OR=3.06, 95% CI=1.398-6.700) were significantly associated with increased risk of NIHL after adjustment for confounding factors.

The present study expands our knowledge of FDXR variants and related phenotypes, and provides new information on the genetic defects associated with this disease for clinical diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 International Society for Developmental Neuroscience",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1002%2fjdn.10104,SFX,33742450 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33742450]

We found strong cnr2 expression in hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear and the lateral line (LL), a superficial sensory structure in fish. Next, we demonstrated that sensory synapses in HCs were severely perturbed in larvae lacking cnr2. Appearance and distribution of presynaptic ribbons and calcium channels (Cav1.3) were profoundly altered in mutant animals. Clustering of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) in post-synaptic densities (PSDs) was also heavily affected, suggesting a role for cnr2 for maintaining the sensory synapse. Furthermore, vesicular trafficking in HCs was strongly perturbed suggesting a retrograde action of the endocannabinoid system (ECs) via cnr2 that was modulating HC mechanotransduction. We found similar perturbations in retinal ribbon synapses. Finally, we showed that larval swimming behaviors after sound and light stimulations were significantly different in mutant animals. Thus, we propose that cnr2 is critical for the processing of sensory information in the developing larva.© Copyright © 2021 Colon-Cruz, Rodriguez-Morales, Santana-Cruz, Cantres-Velez, Torrado-Tapias, Lin, Yudowski, Kensler, Marie, Burgess, Renaud, Varshney and Behra.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffnmol.2021.624265,SFX,

The exclusive use of univariate statistical procedures, analyzing one variable at a time, may limit the potential of studies to determine how interactions between variables may, as a network, determine a particular result. The use of multivariate statistical and data mining methods provides the opportunity to analyse many variables together, in order to appreciate how they may function as a system of interacting variables, and how this system or network may change as a result of sensory disorders such as sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus or different types of vestibular dysfunction. Here we provide an overview of the potential applications of multivariate statistical and data mining techniques, such as principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, multiple linear regression, random forest regression, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, random forest classification, Bayesian classification, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, to the study of auditory and vestibular dysfunction, with an emphasis on classification analytic methods that may be used in the search for biomarkers of disease.© Copyright © 2021 Smith and Zheng.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2021.627294,SFX,

Herein we describe the case of a 74 years old woman who presented a pure moderately differentiated middle ear neuroendocrine tumor after a long history of adhesive otitis media. Patient abruptly developed otalgia and a sense of plugged ear. Otomicroscopy revealed a polypoid mass of the external auditory canal. On histopathologic exam a neoplastic proliferation of monomorphous epithelioid cells arranged in small nests and clusters was present, being positive to cytokeratins, chromogranin, synaptophysin and CD56, and negative to S100. Ki-67 proliferation index was 20%. The lesion was diagnosed as a moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET grade 2). CT and PET scans highlighted the concurrent presence of locoregional lymph nodes involvement but also at distance liver metastases. The patient underwent chemotherapy and liver repetitions were treated locally. At the time of the writing the patient is in good general condition. We describe an exceeding rare case of a moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with primitivity in the middle ear and concurrent distant metastasis at the time of the diagnosis.

MicroRNA (miRNA) perilymph profiling is a safe methodology and may serve as a ""liquid biopsy"" equivalent. We used machine learning (ML) to evaluate miRNA expression profiles of various inner ear pathologies to predict diagnosis of Meniere's disease. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting(s): Tertiary academic hospital. Subjects and Methods: Perilymph was collected during labyrinthectomy (Meniere's disease, n = 5), stapedotomy (otosclerosis, n = 5), and cochlear implantation (sensorineural hearing loss [SNHL], n = 9). miRNA was isolated and analyzed with the Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 array. Various ML classification models were evaluated with an 80/20 train/test split and cross-validation. Permutation feature importance was performed to understand miRNAs that were critical to the classification models. Result(s): In terms of miRNA profiles for conductive hearing loss versus Meniere's, 4 models were able to differentiate and identify the 2 disease classes with 100% accuracy. The top-performing models used the same miRNAs in their decision classification model but with different weighted values. All candidate models for SNHL versus Meniere's performed significantly worse, with the best models achieving 66% accuracy. Meniere's models showed unique features distinct from SNHL. Conclusion(s): We can use ML to build Meniere's-specific prediction models using miRNA profile alone. However, ML models were less accurate in predicting SNHL from Meniere's, likely from overlap of miRNA biomarkers. The power of this technique is that it identifies biomarkers without knowledge of the pathophysiology, potentially leading to identification of novel biomarkers and diagnostic tests.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1177%2f0194599820940649,SFX,32663060 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32663060]

Differences in neural response to ARI stimuli may enable classification of tinnitus and a tailored approach to intervention in the future. In an exploratory study, we investigated the use of a brain-inspired artificial neural network to examine the effects of ARI on electroencephalographic function, as well as the predictive ability of the model. Ten tinnitus patients underwent two auditory stimulation conditions (constant and amplitude modulated broadband noise) at two time points and were then characterised as responders or non-responders, based on whether they experienced ARI or not. Using a spiking neural network model, we evaluated concurrent neural patterns generated across space and time from features of electroencephalographic data, capturing the neural dynamic changes before and after stimulation. Results indicated that the model may be used to predict the effect of auditory stimulation on tinnitus on an individual basis. This approach may aid in the development of predictive models for treatment selection.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Children with unilateral hearing have normal hearing in one ear but no access to binaural cues. Their cognitive and academic deficits could be unique from children receiving bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) at young ages who have poor access to spectral cues and impaired binaural sensitivity. Both groups are at risk for vestibular/balance deficits which could further contribute to memory and learning challenges. Eighty-eight children (43 male:45 female, aged 9.89+/-3.40 years), grouped by unilateral hearing loss (n=20), bilateral CI (n=32), and typically developing (n=36), completed a battery of sensory, cognitive, and academic tests. Analyses revealed that children in both hearing loss groups had significantly poorer skills (accounting for age) on most tests than their normal hearing peers. Children with unilateral hearing loss had more asymmetric speech perception than children with bilateral CIs (p<.0001) but balance and language deficits (p=.0004, p<.0001, respectively) were similar in the two hearing loss groups (p>.05). Visuospatial memory deficits occurred in both hearing loss groups (p=.02) but more consistently across tests in children with unilateral hearing loss. Verbal memory was not significantly different than normal (p>.05). Principal component analyses revealed deficits in a main cluster of visuospatial memory, oral language, mathematics, and reading measures (explaining 46.8% data variability).

No prior studies have attempted a contemporary machine learning approach to predict depression using subjective and objective hearing loss predictors. The objective was to deploy supervised machine learning to predict scores on a validated depression scale using subjective and objective audiometric variables and other health determinant predictors. DESIGN: A large predictor set of health determinants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015-2016 database was used to predict adults' scores on a validated instrument to screen for the presence and severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). After model training, the relative influence of individual predictors on depression scores was stratified and analyzed. Model prediction performance was determined by prediction error metrics. RESULT(S): The test set mean absolute error was 3.03 (95% confidence interval: 2.91 to 3.14) and 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 2.48 to 2.62) on datasets with audiology-only predictors and all predictors, respectively, on the PHQ-9's 27-point scale. Participants' self-reported frustration when talking to members of family or friends due to hearing loss was the fifth-most influential of all predictors. Of the top 10 most influential audiometric predictors, five were related to social contexts, two for significant noise exposure, two objective audiometric parameters, and one presence of bothersome tinnitus. CONCLUSION(S): Machine learning algorithms can accurately predict PHQ-9 depression scale scores from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. The most influential audiometric predictors of higher scores on a validated depression scale were social dynamics of hearing loss and not objective audiometric testing. Such models could be useful in predicting depression scale scores at the point-of-care in conjunction with a standard audiologic assessment.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary and secondary referral center. PATIENTS: Audiograms of 111 subjects with the p.(Pro51Ser) mutation in the COCH-gene were analyzed cross-sectionally. A subset of 17 subjects with repeated audiograms were used for longitudinal analysis. INTERVENTIONS: All audiological thresholds were run through the web-based AudioGene v4.0 software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity for accurate prediction of DFNA9 for cross-sectional data and concordance of correct prediction for longitudinal auditory data. RESULT(S): DFNA9 was predicted with a sensitivity of 93.7% in a series of 222 cross-sectionally collected audiological thresholds (76.1% as first gene locus). When using the hearing thresholds of the best ear, the sensitivity was 94.6%. The sensitivity was significantly higher in DFNA9 patients aged younger than 40 and aged 60 years or older, compared to the age group of 40 to 59 years, with resp. 97.6% (p < 0.0001) and 98.8% (p < 0.0001) accurate predictions. An average concordance of 91.6% was found to show the same response in all successive longitudinal audiometric data per patient. CONCLUSION(S): Audioprofiling software can accurately predict DFNA9 in an area with a high prevalence of confirmed carriers of the p.(Pro51Ser) variant in the COCH-gene. This algorithm yields high promises for helping clinicians in directing genetic testing in case of a strong family history of progressive hearing loss, especially for very young and old carriers.Copyright © 2021, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1097%2fMAO.0000000000003028,SFX,33492061 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33492061]

Material(s) and Method(s): In this single institution retrospective study, 171 patients with H&N or CNS tumours were treated with radiation, with or without chemotherapy and had longitudinal (>2) audiological evaluation. SIOP-Boston (SIOP) and Chang grades were assigned to 2,420 hearing assessments of 342 ears; analyses using SIOP grades are presented here. For the nomogram, SIOP Grade >3 was considered clinically-significant HL (requiring hearing aids). An Andersen-Gill model for recurrent events was used to obtain inverse intensity weights to account for factors explaining the number of assessments. Multivariable weighted ordinal logistic regression was fitted to evaluate the effect of clinicopathologic features on HL. Clustered robust standard errors were calculated to account for intrapatient correlation. Result(s): Patients underwent a median of six (range 2-23) assessments over a median of 3.1 years from diagnosis to last audiogram (range 0.1-15.2 years).

Classically, analytical models of auditory neurons and synapses are derived from experimental transfer functions derived from neuronal recordings. This has resulted in a variety of models, typically formulated using multi-branch Hodgkin-Huxley or coupled ODE systems comprising a number of nonlinearities. The more accurate the models are in capturing the nonlinear and adaptation properties of the biophysical system, the more computationally expensive they become. While detailed and realistic analytical models are essential to relate biophysical properties and parameters directly to their functional impact on neuronal processing, their computational load has limited their uptake in large scale brain simulation systems (e.g., for sound perception) or in methods for augmented hearing. The latter applications typically resort to faster-but biophysically less accurate-model units or adopt machine learning to map sound to output features. It is clear that both fast (machine-learning) and slow (analytical, biophysical) approaches have their benefits, but for neuroscience purposes it is essential that experimental neuroscientific advances can easily be cast into incrementally improved encoding models that generalize beyond a single experiment.Here, we present a hybrid, computational neuroscience and machine-learning approach to develop biophysically realistic convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptions of auditory neurons and synapses that predict their classical neuroscientific properties (nonlinearities, adaptation time-constants, frequency characteristics). To this end, we adopted state-of-the-art analytical model descriptions of auditory neurons/synapses to generate a training data set of neuronal responses to a speech corpus. Those simulations were used to train a CNN (L1-loss), which performance was benchmarked on predicting outcomes of six classical auditory neuroscience experiments (using unseen, non-speech stimuli). We used the benchmarking to optimize the hyperparameters of the initial CNN architecture (layer numbers, filter length, activation type, context) in a principled way. This yielded CNN model predictions conform the experimental observations. Because we successfully applied our method to a range of analytical neuron/synapse models with various degrees of complexity, we could derive a method to select an appropriate initial CNN architecture based on its receptive field and estimated adaptation time-constant of the to-be-modelled neuron/synapse. We required 3 to 14 encoder layers to sufficiently capture the neuroscientific properties of the giant axon, cochlea, inner-hair-cell or auditory-nerve-fiber synapse. Based on these minimally required model sizes, we conclude that machine-hearing systems that aim to maintain a relation to the underlying biophysical process need to be modular and have considerable sizes. Nonetheless, our CNN model units have clear advantages over their analytical counterparts, in that they are differentiable for back-propagation purposes (e.g., for hearing-aid algorithm design) and can be parallelized for GPU computing of large-scale neuronal population models (e.g., behavior, evoked responses) to accelerate neuroscience discoveries.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1007%2fs10827-021-00801-9,SFX,

The attenuation component is linked to the absolute hearing threshold and affects speech recognition in quiet. It can theoretically be compensated by amplification. However, there seems to be no psychoacoustic correlate for the distortion component which affects speech recognition in quiet and noise. A method to assess the distortion component is desired since it provides further information for developping and fitting hearing aids. While no clear prediction method of distortion was available for decades, the FADE model (Framework for Auditory Discrimination Experiments) was used to successfully infer supra-threshold model parameters from psychoacoustic experiments. Here, this approach is examined. Methods 95 hearing impaired listeners measured speech recognition thresholds (SRTs, 50 % word recognition rate) in quiet and noise with different maskers and noise levels as well as psychoacoustic tone detection thresholds in quiet and noise. The distortion component was estimated by fitting Plomp curves to the measured SRTs, while it was estimated from psychoacoustic detection thresholds with linear regression models or FADE. Results Linear regression models could not predict the distortion component. FADE accurately predicts SRTs with root-meansquared prediction errors (RMSE) of 3.4 dB and an R2 of 0.97 (squared Pearson's correlation coefficient) when using the inferred supra-threshold distortion component. An R2 of 0.57 (RMSE = 1.8 dB) was found between the measured and FADE's predicted distortion component. Conclusion While linear regression models seem to be incapabale of predicting Pomp's distortion component, an indirect approach via FADE seems to be viable. That no linear correlation could be observed between the pychoacoustic measurement outcomes and the speech recognition performance in noise might be an important reason why Plomp's simple concept was not backed up by appropriate models for decades.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1515%2fbmt-2021-6053,SFX,

Hereby, we describe a case of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome in a patient who initially presented with clusters of focal seizures originating in left occipital lobe and subsequently migrated to contralateral side with migrating imaging lesions. Design/Methods: Not applicable Case Description: A developmentally normal 16 years old teenage boy with seizure semiology of occipital lobe onset on Levetiracetam 1000mg BID presented to the ER with clusters of focal seizures. The episodes consist of gaze and head deviation to the right with hemiclonic jerks and unawareness for about 20 to 30 seconds, vomiting, and confusion and drowsiness between the events. EEG showed spike and wave activity in left occipital head regions building up to fast rhythmic activity. MRI showed T2 hyperintense signal in left occipital lobe involving left temporal area. We added Lacosamide(LCS) 200 mg BID to Levetiracetam 1500mg BID on which he remained stable for eight months. Further, he presented to ER with similar semiology of seizures but on left side. EEG showed right occipital epileptiform discharges. MRI head showed T2 hyperintense signal in right occipital-temporal lobes. We sent samples for genetic screening to rule out possible mitochondrial syndrome. MT.TLI gene mutation m.3243 A>G was found along with lactic acidosis. MRI of the patient's heart showed mild apical septal hypo-kinesia. Audiometry revealed bilateral asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. AS a result, we reached a confirmed diagnosis of MT.TLI gene mutation m.3243 A>G with MELAS (Mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) phenotype. Conclusion(s): Alternating seizure focus on EEG and alternating/resolving imaging changes should prompt a mitochondrial disorder investigation.

However, data are scarce, especially on adult populations, and a possible involvement of the central auditory areas has not been investigated yet. Aim(s): We aimed at investigating the metabolism of the cerebral auditory areas in thalassemia, trying also exploratively to assess if this may correlate with the cognitive impairment previously shown in this disease. Method(s): We performed a multicenter cross-sectional audiological and single-center 3Tesla brain perfusion MRI study enrolling 77 transfusion- dependent/non transfusion-dependent adult patients and 56 healthy controls. Pure tone audiometry, demographics, clinical/laboratory and cognitive functioning data were recorded. Result(s): Half of patients (52%) presented with high-frequency hearing deficit, with overt hypoacusia (Pure Tone Average (PTA)>25dB) in 35%, irrespective of iron chelation or clinical phenotype. Bilateral voxel clusters of significant relative hypoperfusion were found in the auditory cortex of beta-thalassemia patients, regardless of clinical phenotype. In controls and transfusion-dependent (but not in non-transfusion-dependent) patients, the relative auditory cortex perfusion values increased linearly with age (p<0.04). Relative auditory cortex perfusion values showed a significant U-shaped correlation with PTA values among hearing loss patients, and a linear correlation with the full scale intelligence quotient (right side p=0.01, left side p=0.02) with its domain related to communication skills (right side p=0.04, left side p=0.07) in controls but not in beta-thalassemia patients. Audiometric test results did not correlate to cognitive test scores in any subgroup. Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, primary auditory cortex perfusion changes are a metabolic hallmark of adult beta-thalassemia, thus suggesting complex remodeling of the hearing function, that occurs regardless of chelation therapy and before clinically manifest hearing loss.

Current masking protocols are confusing, laborious, and time consuming. Adding a standardized masking protocol to an active machine learning audiogram procedure could potentially alleviate all of these drawbacks by dynamically adapting the masking as needed for each individual. The goal of this study is to determine the accuracy and efficiency of automated machine learning masking for obtaining true hearing thresholds. DESIGN: Dynamically masked automated audiograms were collected for 29 participants between the ages of 21 and 83 (mean 43, SD 20) with a wide range of hearing abilities. Normal-hearing listeners were given unmasked and masked machine learning audiogram tests. Listeners with hearing loss were given a standard audiogram test by an audiologist, with masking stimuli added as clinically determined, followed by a masked machine learning audiogram test. The hearing thresholds estimated for each pair of techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8kHz). RESULT(S): Masked and unmasked machine learning audiogram threshold estimates matched each other well in normal-hearing listeners, with a mean absolute difference between threshold estimates of 3.4 dB. Masked machine learning audiogram thresholds also matched well the thresholds determined by a conventional masking procedure, with a mean absolute difference between threshold estimates for listeners with low asymmetry and high asymmetry between the ears, respectively, of 4.9 and 2.6 dB. Notably, out of 6200 masked machine learning audiogram tone deliveries for this study, no instances of tones detected by the nontest ear were documented. The machine learning methods were also generally faster than the manual methods, and for some listeners, substantially so. CONCLUSION(S): Dynamically masked audiograms achieve accurate true threshold estimates and reduce test time compared with current clinical masking procedures. Dynamic masking is a compelling alternative to the methods currently used to evaluate individuals with highly asymmetric hearing, yet can also be used effectively and efficiently for anyone.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000891,SFX,33136643 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33136643]

This was done using a large dataset of commercially available hearing aids. To achieve this, we investigated which hearing aid features are suitable for comparison, and are also relevant for the rehabilitation of hearing impairment. To compare hearing aids objectively, we distinguished populations of hearing aids based on a set of key hearing aid features. Finally, we describe these hearing aid subpopulations so that these could potentially be used as a supporting tool for the selection of an appropriate hearing aid. DESIGN: In this study, we used technical (meta-)data from 3911 hearing aids (available on the Dutch market in March 2018). The dataset contained about 50 of the most important characteristics of a hearing aid. After cleaning and handling the data via a well-defined knowledge discovery in database procedure, a total 3083 hearing aids were included. Subsequently, a set of well-defined key hearing aid features were used as input for further analysis. The data were split into an in-the-ear style hearing aid subset and a behind-the-ear style subset, for separate analyses. The knowledge discovery in databases procedure was also used as an objective guiding tool for applying an exploratory cluster analysis to expose subpopulations of hearing aids within the dataset. The latter was done using Latent Class Tree Analysis, which is an extension to the better-known Latent Class Analysis clustering method: with the important addition of a hierarchical structure. RESULT(S): A total of 10 hearing aid features were identified as relevant for audiological rehabilitation: compression, sound processing, noise reduction (NR), expansion, wind NR, impulse (noise) reduction, active feedback management, directionality, NR environments, and ear-to-ear communication. These features had the greatest impact on results yielded by the Latent Class Tree cluster analysis. At the first level in the hierarchical cluster model, the two subpopulations of hearing aids could be divided into 3 main branches, mainly distinguishable by the overall availability or technology level of hearing aid features. Higher-level results of the cluster analysis yielded a set of mutually exclusive hearing aid populations, called modalities. In total, nine behind-the-ear and seven in-the-ear modalities were found. These modalities were characterized by particular profiles of (complex) interplay between the selected key features. A technical comparison of features (e.g., implementation) is beyond the scope of this research. CONCLUSION(S): Combining a large dataset of hearing aids with a probabilistic hierarchical clustering method enables analysis of hearing aid characteristics which extends beyond product families and manufacturers.

Study Design: Single-institution prospective study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral center. Subjects and Methods: Eleven NH and 9 IWHL participants in a sound-isolated booth facing a speaker through a window. In non-VSRP conditions, SP was evaluated on 40 Bamford-Kowal-Bench speech-in-noise test (BKB-SIN) sentences presented by the speaker at 50 A-weighted decibels (dBA) with multiperson babble noise presented from 50 to 75 dBA. SP was defined as the percentage of words correctly identified. In VSRP conditions, an infrared camera was used to track 35 points around the speaker's lips during speech in real time. Lip movement data were translated into speech-text via an in-house developed neural network-based VSRP. SP was evaluated similarly in the non-VSRP condition on 42 BKB-SIN sentences, with the addition of the VSRP output presented on a screen to the listener. Result(s): In high-noise conditions (70-75 dBA) without VSRP, NH listeners achieved significantly higher speech perception than IWHL listeners (38.7% vs 25.0%, P =.02). NH listeners were significantly more accurate with VSRP than without VSRP (75.5% vs 38.7%, P <.0001), as were IWHL listeners (70.4% vs 25.0% P <.0001). With VSRP, no significant difference in SP was observed between NH and IWHL listeners (75.5% vs 70.4%, P =.15). Conclusion(s): The VSRP significantly increased speech perception in high-noise conditions for NH and IWHL participants and eliminated the difference in SP accuracy between NH and IWHL listeners.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1177%2f0194599820924331,SFX,32453650 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32453650]

On top of the existing hearing aids and cochlear implants, there is a growing effort to regenerate functional tissues and restore hearing. However, studying and evaluating these regenerative medicine approaches in a big animal model (e.g. pigs) whose anatomy, physiology, and organ size are similar to a human is challenging. In big animal models, the cochlea is bulky, intricate, and veiled in a dense and craggy otic capsule. These facts complicate 3D microscopic analysis that is vital in the cochlea, where structure-function relation is time and again manifested. To allow 3D imaging of an intact cochlea of newborn and juvenile pigs with a volume up to ~ 250 mm3, we adapted the BoneClear tissue clearing technique, which renders the bone transparent. The transparent cochleae were then imaged with cellular resolution and in a timely fashion, which prevented bubble formation and tissue degradation, using an adaptive custom-built light-sheet fluorescence microscope. The adaptive light-sheet microscope compensated for deflections of the illumination beam by changing the angles of the beam and translating the detection objective while acquiring images. Using this combination of techniques, macroscopic and microscopic properties of the cochlea were extracted, including the density of hair cells, frequency maps, and lower frequency limits. Consequently, the proposed platform could support the growing effort to regenerate cochlear tissues and assist with basic research to advance cures for hearing impairments.Copyright © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1364%2fBOE.402991,SFX,

(Haro, Quatieri) Speech and Hearing Biosciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States",Frontiers Media S.A.,"Many individuals struggle to understand speech in listening scenarios that include reverberation and background noise. An individual's ability to understand speech arises from a combination of peripheral auditory function, central auditory function, and general cognitive abilities. The interaction of these factors complicates the prescription of treatment or therapy to improve hearing function. Damage to the auditory periphery can be studied in animals; however, this method alone is not enough to understand the impact of hearing loss on speech perception. Computational auditory models bridge the gap between animal studies and human speech perception. Perturbations to the modeled auditory systems can permit mechanism-based investigations into observed human behavior. In this study, we propose a computational model that accounts for the complex interactions between different hearing damage mechanisms and simulates human speech-in-noise perception. The model performs a digit classification task as a human would, with only acoustic sound pressure as input. Thus, we can use the model's performance as a proxy for human performance. This two-stage model consists of a biophysical cochlear-nerve spike generator followed by a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. We hypothesize that sudden damage to the periphery affects speech perception and that central nervous system adaptation over time may compensate for peripheral hearing damage. Our model achieved human-like performance across signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) under normal-hearing (NH) cochlear settings, achieving 50% digit recognition accuracy at -20.7 dB SNR. Results were comparable to eight NH participants on the same task who achieved 50% behavioral performance at -22 dB SNR. We also simulated medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) and auditory nerve fiber (ANF) loss, which worsened digit-recognition accuracy at lower SNRs compared to higher SNRs. Our simulated performance following ANF loss is consistent with the hypothesis that cochlear synaptopathy impacts communication in background noise more so than in quiet. Following the insult of various cochlear degradations, we implemented extreme and conservative adaptation through the DNN. At the lowest SNRs (<0 dB), both adapted models were unable to fully recover NH performance, even with hundreds of thousands of training samples. This implies a limit on performance recovery following peripheral damage in our human-inspired DNN architecture.© Copyright © 2020 Haro, Smalt, Ciccarelli and Quatieri.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2020.588448,SFX,

Among various types of hearing loss, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) has been extensively reported to be associated with tinnitus. However, the reason that tinnitus develops selectively in some patients with SSNHL remains elusive, which led us to hypothesize that patients with SSNHL with tinnitus (SSNHL-T) and those without tinnitus (SSNHL-NT) may exhibit different cortical activity patterns. In the current study, we compared resting-state quantitative electroencephalography findings between 13 SSNHL-T and 13 SSNHL-NT subjects strictly matched for demographic characteristics and hearing thresholds. By performing whole-brain source localization analysis complemented by functional connectivity analysis, we aimed to determine the as-yet-unidentified cortical oscillatory signatures that may reveal potential prerequisites for the perception of tinnitus in patients with SSNHL. Compared with the SSNHL-NT group, the SSNHL-T group showed significantly higher cortical activity in Bayesian inferential network areas such as the frontopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) for the beta 3 and gamma frequency bands. This suggests that tinnitus develops in a brain with sudden auditory deafferentation only if the Bayesian inferential network updates the missing auditory information and the pgACC-based top-down gatekeeper system is actively involved. Additionally, significantly increased connectivity between the OFC and precuneus for the gamma frequency band was observed in the SSNHL-T group, further suggesting that tinnitus derived from Bayesian inference may be linked to the default mode network so that tinnitus is regarded as normal. Taken together, our preliminary results suggest a possible mechanism for the selective development of tinnitus in patients with SSNHL. Also, these areas could serve as the potential targets of neuromodulatory approaches to preventing the development or prolonged perception of tinnitus in subjects with SSNHL.© Copyright © 2020 Lee, Choi, Koo, De Ridder and Song.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2020.596647,SFX,

Currently there is no objective measure of tinnitus that can be used clinically. Clinical assessment of the condition uses subjective feedback from individuals which is not always reliable. We investigated the sensitivity of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to differentiate individuals with and without tinnitus and to identify fNIRS features associated with subjective ratings of tinnitus severity. We recorded fNIRS signals in the resting state and in response to auditory or visual stimuli from 25 individuals with chronic tinnitus and 21 controls matched for age and hearing loss. Severity of tinnitus was rated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and subjective ratings of tinnitus loudness and annoyance were measured on a visual analogue scale. Following statistical group comparisons, machine learning methods including feature extraction and classification were applied to the fNIRS features to classify patients with tinnitus and controls and differentiate tinnitus at different severity levels. Resting state measures of connectivity between temporal regions and frontal and occipital regions were significantly higher in patients with tinnitus compared to controls. In the tinnitus group, temporal-occipital connectivity showed a significant increase with subject ratings of loudness. Also in this group, both visual and auditory evoked responses were significantly reduced in the visual and auditory regions of interest respectively. Naive Bayes classifiers were able to classify patients with tinnitus from controls with an accuracy of 78.3%. An accuracy of 87.32% was achieved using Neural Networks to differentiate patients with slight/ mild versus moderate/ severe tinnitus. Our findings show the feasibility of using fNIRS and machine learning to develop an objective measure of tinnitus. Such a measure would greatly benefit clinicians and patients by providing a tool to objectively assess new treatments and patients' treatment progress.Copyright © 2020 Shoushtarian et al.

A proper analysis to ascertain the main risk factors is essential in order to diagnose early and treat adequately. An exploratory analysis based on a heterogeneous sample of 1418 workers is presented in order to identify the main trigger factors for hearing loss. On the one hand, we recorded several medical and environmental parameters, and on the other, we created a model based on Bayesian networks in order to be able to infer the probability of hearing loss considering different scenarios. This paper focuses on three parameters: gender, age, and a family history of hearing problems. The results obtained allow us to infer or predict the best or worst auditory level for an individual under several different scenarios. The least relevant factor is the existence of a family history of deafness, followed by the gender factor, which slopes considerably toward better hearing for females, and most prominent of all, the age factor, given the large differences identified between the various age groups when the gender and family history of deafness variables remain constant.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

DESIGN: Study participants included 23 children with cochlear nerve deficiency (CND), 29 children with normal-sized CNs (NSCNs), and 20 adults with various etiologies of hearing loss. Eight participants were bilateral CI users and were tested in both ears. As a result, a total of 80 ears were tested in this study. All participants used Cochlear Nucleus CIs in their test ears. For each participant, the CN refractory recovery function and input/output (I/O) function were measured using electrophysiological measures of the electrically evoked compound action potential (eCAP) at three electrode sites across the electrode array. Refractory recovery time constants were estimated using statistical modeling with an exponential decay function. Slopes of I/O functions were estimated using linear regression. The eCAP parameters used as input variables in the predictive model were absolute refractory recovery time estimated based on the refractory recovery function, eCAP threshold, slope of the eCAP I/O function, and negative-peak (i.e., N1) latency. The output variable of the predictive model was CN index, an indicator for the functional status of the CN. Predictive models were created by performing linear regression, support vector machine regression, and logistic regression with eCAP parameters from children with CND and the children with NSCNs. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis with Tukey's honest significant difference criterion was used to compare study variables among study groups. RESULT(S): All three machine learning algorithms created two distinct distributions of CN indices for children with CND and children with NSCNs. Variations in CN index when calculated using different machine learning techniques were observed for adult CI users. Regardless of these variations, CN indices calculated using all three techniques in adult CI users were significantly correlated with Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant word and AzBio sentence scores measured in quiet. The five oldest CI users had smaller CN indices than the five youngest CI users in this study. CONCLUSION(S): The functional status of the CN for individual CI users was estimated by our newly developed analytical models. Model predictions of CN function for individual adult CI users were positively and significantly correlated with speech perception performance. The models presented in this study may be useful for understanding and/or predicting CI outcomes for individual patients.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Method A data set that is representative of the older adult U.S. population with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss was constructed from the audiometric data of 934 adults (aged 55-85 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 1999-2012. Two clustering approaches were implemented to generate common REAR configurations for eight frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) at three input levels (55, 65, and 75 dB SPL). (a) In the REAR-based clustering approach, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey audiograms were first converted to REAR targets and then clustered to generate common REAR configurations. (b) In the audiogram-based clustering approach, the audiograms were first clustered into common hearing loss profiles and then converted to REAR configurations. The trade-off between the number of available REAR configurations and the percentage of the U.S. population whose hearing loss could be fit by at least one of them (i.e., percent coverage) was evaluated. Hearing loss fit was defined as less than +/- 5-dB difference between an individual's REAR targets and those of the clustered REAR configuration. Results Percent coverage increases with the number of available REAR configurations, with four configurations resulting in 75% population coverage. Overall, REAR-based clustering yielded 5 percentage points better coverage on average compared to audiogram-based clustering. Conclusions The common REAR configurations can be used for programming the gain frequency responses in preconfigured over-the-counter hearing aids and provide clinically appropriate amplification settings for older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1044%2f2020_AJA-20-00025,SFX,32693613 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32693613]

Result(s): Four teams completed the survey in 24days. 1080 of 1153 (93.7%) participants were examined. The median time to complete the protocol was 24min/participant. Prevalence of hearing loss was 35.9% (95% CI = 31.6-40.2) (any level); and 10.0% (95% CI = 7.9-12.5) (>=moderate). The majority was classified as probable sensorineural. Nearly one third of people (30.9%) needed diagnostic audiology services and possible hearing aid fitting. Hearing aid coverage was <1%. Lack of perceived need was a key barrier.

Those with pre-existing hearing loss are at particular risk of clinically important hearing loss with aminoglycoside-containing treatment than those with normal hearing at baseline. This study aimed to identify factors associated with pre-existing hearing loss among patients being treated for DR-TB in South Africa. Method Cross-sectional analysis nested within a cluster-randomized trial data across 10 South African TB hospitals. Patients >= 13 years old received clinical and audiological evaluations before DR-TB treatment initiation. Results Of 936 patients, average age was 35 years. One hundred forty-two (15%) reported pre-existing auditory symptoms. Of 482 patients tested by audiometry, 290 (60%) had pre-existing hearing loss. The prevalence of pre-existing hearing loss was highest among patients >= 50 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPrR] for symptoms 5.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) [3.63, 8.42]; aPrR for audiometric hearing loss 1.63, 95% CI [1.31, 2.03] compared to age 13-18 years) and among those with a prior history of second-line TB treatment (aPrR for symptoms 1.73, 95% CI [1.66, 1.80]; PrR for audiometric hearing loss 1.33, 95% CI [1.03, 1.73]). Having HIV with cluster of differentiation 4 cell count < 200 cells/mm3 and malnutrition were risk factors but did not reach statistical significance in adjusted analyses.

Method Audiometric testing data collected in the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study from participants (n = 1,369) with four visits (1993-1995, 1998-2000, 2003-2005, and 2009-2010) were included (10,952 audiograms). Cluster analyses (Wald's method) were used to identify audiometric patterns. Maximum allowable threshold values were defined for each cluster to create an ordered scale. Progression was defined as a two-step change. Results An eight-step scale was developed to capture audiogram shape and severity of hearing impairment. Of the 1,094 participants classified as having normal hearing based on a pure-tone average, only 25% (n = 277) were classified as Level 1 (all thresholds <= 20 dB HL) on the new scale, whereas 17% (n = 182) were Levels 4-6. During the 16-year follow-up, 64.9% of those at Level 1 progressed. There was little regression using this scale. Conclusions This is the first scale developed from population-based longitudinal cohort data to capture audiogram shape across time.

( Netherlands),"Successful mapping of meaningful labels to sound input requires accurate representation of that sound's acoustic variances in time and spectrum. For some individuals, such as children or those with hearing loss, having an objective measure of the integrity of this representation could be useful. Classification is a promising machine learning approach which can be used to objectively predict a stimulus label from the brain response. This approach has been previously used with auditory evoked potentials (AEP) such as the frequency following response (FFR), but a number of key issues remain unresolved before classification can be translated into clinical practice. Specifically, past efforts at FFR classification have used data from a given subject for both training and testing the classifier. It is also unclear which components of the FFR elicit optimal classification accuracy. To address these issues, we recorded FFRs from 13 adults with normal hearing in response to speech and music stimuli. We compared labeling accuracy of two cross-validation classification approaches using FFR data: (1) a more traditional method combining subject data in both the training and testing set, and (2) a ""leave-one-out"" approach, in which subject data is classified based on a model built exclusively from the data of other individuals. We also examined classification accuracy on decomposed and time-segmented FFRs. Our results indicate that the accuracy of leave-one-subject-out cross validation approaches that obtained in the more conventional cross-validation classifications while allowing a subject's results to be analysed with respect to normative data pooled from a separate population. In addition, we demonstrate that classification accuracy is highest when the entire FFR is used to train the classifier. Taken together, these efforts contribute key steps toward translation of classification-based machine learning approaches into clinical practice.Copyright © 2020",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2020.108101,SFX,33142106 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33142106]

Despite that, HA use is suboptimal, and communication issues and hearing-related activity limitations and participation restrictions often remain. Web-based self-management communication programs may support people with hearing loss to effectively self-manage the impact of hearing loss in their daily lives. Objective(s): The goal of the research is to examine the short- and long-term effects of a web-based self-management SUpport PRogram (SUPR) on communication strategy use (primary outcome) and a range of secondary outcomes for HA users aged 50 years and older. Method(s): Clients of 36 HA dispensing practices were randomized to SUPR (SUPR recipients; n=180 HA users) and 34 to care as usual (controls; n=163 HA users). SUPR recipients received a practical support booklet and online materials delivered via email over the course of their 6-month HA rehabilitation trajectory. They were encouraged to appoint a communication partner and were offered optional email contact with the HA dispensing practice. The online materials included 3 instruction videos on HA handling, 5 videos on communication strategies, and 3 testimonial videos. Care as usual included a HA fitting rehabilitation trajectory only. Measurements were carried out at baseline, immediately postintervention, 6 months postintervention, and 12 months postintervention. The primary outcome measure was self-reported use of communication strategies (3 subscales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired [CPHI]). Secondary outcome measures included self-reported personal adjustment to hearing loss (CPHI); use, satisfaction and benefit of HAs and SUPR (use questionnaire; International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids [IOI-HA], Alternative Interventions [IOI-AI]); recommendation of HA dispensing services; self-efficacy for HA handling (Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids [MARS-HA]); readiness to act on hearing loss (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment adapted for hearing loss [URICA-HL]); and hearing disability (Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap [AIADH]). Result(s): Linear mixed model analyses (intention to treat) showed no significant differences between the SUPR and control group in the course of communication strategy use (CPHI). Immediately postintervention, SUPR recipients showed significantly higher self-efficacy for advanced HA handling than the controls, which was sustained at 12 months (MARS-HA; mean difference immediately postintervention: 5.3, 95% CI 0.3 to 10.4; P=.04). Also, SUPR recipients showed significantly greater HA satisfaction than controls immediately postintervention (IOI-HA; 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.5; P=.006), which was sustained at 12 months, and significantly greater HA use than the controls immediately postintervention (IOI-HA; 0.3, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.5; P=.03), which was not sustained at 12 months. Conclusion(s): This study provides ground to recommend adding SUPR to standard HA dispensing care, as long-term, modest improvements in HA outcomes were observed. Further research is needed to evaluate what adjustments to SUPR are needed to establish long-term effectiveness on outcomes in the psychosocial domain.Copyright © Janine FJ Meijerink, Marieke Pronk, Birgit I Lissenberg-Witte, Vera Jansen, Sophia E Kramer.

Her past medical history was significant for global developmental delay, and she was attending fourth grade special education classes. On examination, she had an ataxic gait, dysarthria, absent deep tendon reflexes, and flexor plantar responses. There were no signs of optic atrophy or hearing loss. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with an axonal neuropathy. A fascicular sural nerve biopsy showed a marked decrease of myelinated fibers larger than 6 microm in diameter as compared with an age-matched control. By electron microscopy, clusters of degenerating axonal mitochondria in both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were frequently found. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous c.314C > T (p.Thr105Met) missense variant in MFN2 in the patient but not in her mother. The father was unavailable for testing. The phenotypes with MFN2 variants can be quite variable, including intellectual disability, optic atrophy, auditory impairment, spinal atrophy with or without hydromyelia, and hydrocephalus.

On the other hand, chrono-nutritional studies have shown that time-restricted feeding during active phase significantly suppresses the induction of HFDinduced obesity in mouse model. However, the long-term effects of time-restricted HFD feeding on aging are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we set up a total of four groups: mutual combination of ad libitum feeding or night-time-restricted feeding (NtRF) and an HFD or a control diet. We examined their long-term effects in a senescence-accelerated mouse strain, SAMP8, for over a year. Hearing ability, cognitive function, and other behavioral and physiological indexes were evaluated during the study. Unexpectedly, SAMP8 mice did not show early onset of death caused by the prolonged HFD intake, and both HFD and NtRF retarded age-related hearing loss (AHL). NtRF improved grip strength and cognitive memory scores, while HFD weakly suppressed age-related worsening of the appearance scores associated with the eyes. Notably, the HFD also retarded the progression of AHL in both DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest that HFD prevents aging unless metabolic disorders occur and that HFD and NtRF are independently effective in retarding aging; thus, the combination of HFD and chrono-nutritional feeding may be an effective anti-aging strategy.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

E-mail: info@frontiersin.org)","Background: Sensory gating describes neurological processes of filtering out redundant or unnecessary stimuli during information processing, and sensory gating deficits may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. Among the three components of auditory event-related potentials reflecting sensory gating, P50 implies pre-attentional filtering of sensory information and N100/P200 reflects attention triggering and allocation processes. Although diminished P50 gating has been extensively documented in patients with schizophrenia, previous studies on N100 were inconclusive, and P200 has been rarely examined. This study aimed to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia have P50, N100, and P200 gating deficits compared with control subjects. Method(s): Control subjects and clinically stable schizophrenia patients were recruited. The mid-latency auditory evoked responses, comprising P50, N100, and P200, were measured using the auditory-paired click paradigm without manipulation of attention. Sensory gating parameters included S1 amplitude, S2 amplitude, amplitude difference (S1-S2), and gating ratio (S2/S1). We also evaluated schizophrenia patients with PANSS to be correlated with sensory gating indices. Result(s): One hundred four patients and 102 control subjects were examined. Compared to the control group, schizophrenia patients had significant sensory gating deficits in P50, N100, and P200, reflected by larger gating ratios and smaller amplitude differences. Further analysis revealed that the S2 amplitude of P50 was larger, while the S1 amplitude of N100/P200 was smaller, in schizophrenia patients than in the controls. We found no correlations between sensory gating indices and schizophrenia positive or negative symptom clusters. However, we found a negative correlation between the P200 S2 amplitude and Bell's emotional discomfort factor/Wallwork's depressed factor. Conclusion(s): Till date, this study has the largest sample size to analyze P50, N100, and P200 collectively by adopting the passive auditory paired-click paradigm without distractors. With covariates controlled for possible confounds, such as age, education, smoking amount and retained pairs, we found that schizophrenia patients had significant sensory gating deficits in P50-N100-P200. The schizophrenia patients had demonstrated a unique pattern of sensory gating deficits, including repetition suppression deficits in P50 and stimulus registration deficits in N100/200. These results suggest that sensory gating is a pervasive cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia patients that is not limited to the pre-attentive phase of information processing. Since P200 exhibited a large effect size and did not require additional time during recruitment, future studies of P50-N100-P200 collectively are highly recommended.© Copyright © 2020 Shen, Chou, Lai, Hsieh, Liu, Liu and Hwu.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffpsyt.2020.00868,SFX,

Objective(s): This study investigated the rate of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to working in the steel industry and associated effective factors. Method(s): This historical cohort study was conducted within 2000 to 2010. Two LFH and HFH definitions of NIHL were used in this study. The average changes of LFH and HFL were considered the response variables. In addition, time and occupational (i.e., shift work and work experience) and demographic (i.e., age and educational level) variables were regarded as the independent variables. For data analysis, Bayesian multivariate multilevel modeling using skew distribution and OpenBUGS (version 3.2.2) and R (version 2.13.2) software were used in this study. Result(s): The present study was performed on 1,959 male workers with a mean age of 36.64+/-3.92 years. Among these subjects, 913 (46.6%), 134 (6.8%), and 912 (46.6%) participants were day workers, weekly-rotating shift workers, and routinely-rotating shift workers, respectively. The obtained results showed that age, work experience, educational level, and shift work had significant relationships with the changes of LFH and HFH. Conclusion(s): Overall, the findings of this 10-year historical cohort study demonstrated a relationship between time and demographic and occupational variables with the changes of LFH and HFL. Therefore, it is recommended to design preventive measures to reduce the deleterious effects of such variables on LFH and HFL.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.32592%2fircmj.2020.22.9.78,SFX,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of hearing loss with atherogenic index (AI) in the general population. Methods. A multistage study using cluster random sampling method was conducted in the Zhejiang province from 2016 to 2018. Pure-tone air-conduction hearing thresholds were measured at frequencies of 0.125.8kHz for each subject. After obtaining their consent, all participants were asked to provide their own plasma lipid data. Results. A total of 3,414 eligible participants were included, 1,765 (51.7%) were men and 1,649 (48.3%) were women and 1,113 (32.6%) had hearing loss. Ridge regression showed increased AI in subjects with hearing loss. The subgroup with the highest quartile of AI, presenting the highest risk of hearing loss as compared to the lowest quartile, comprised young and middle-aged women. Further analysis revealed that the AI in people with different categories of hearing loss was higher than that in the normal population, except for those with (extremely) severe hearing loss. Moreover, the young and middle-aged women exhibited the most significant correlations between AI and hearing loss.Copyright © 2020 Huai Zhang et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1515%2fmed-2020-0003,SFX,

Tetramethylpyrazine (Tet) and tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA ) have protective roles against hearing impairment or ototoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and the protective effect of Tet and Tan IIA against it. House Ear Institute-O rgan of Corti 1 auditory cells were treated with titrating doses of Tan IIA , Tet, and cisplatin. In a cell viability assay, cisplatin, Tan IIA and Tet had IC 50 values of 42.89 muM, 151.80 and 1.04x103 mg/l, respectively. Tan IIA augmented cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. However, Tet concentrations <75 mg/l attenuated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis was carried out on auditory cells treated for 30 h with 30 muM cisplatin alone for 48 h or combined with 37.5 mg/l Tet for 30 h. Differentially expressed genes (DE Gs) induced in these conditions were identified and examined using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Cisplatin increased the expression of genes related to the p53 and FoxO pathways, such as Fas, p21/CD KN1A, and Bcl-2 binding component 3, but decreased the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), as well as genes in the histone (Hist)1 and Hist2 clusters. Treatment with Tet downregulated FOXO3 and Bcl-2 binding component 3, and increased the expression of IGF1. Moreover, Tet upregulated genes associated with Wnt signaling, but not p53-related genes. Thus, the otoprotective properties of Tet might be mediated by activation of Wnt and IGF1 signaling, and inhibition of FoxO signaling.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

As AG ototoxicity is dose-dependent, the impact of a surrogate measure of AG exposure on AG-induced hearing loss warrants close attention for settings with limited therapeutic drug monitoring. O B J E C T I V E: To explore the prognostic impact of cumulative AG dose on AG ototoxicity in patients following initiation of AG-containing treatment for MDR-TB. DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was nested within an ongoing cluster-randomized trial of nurse case management intervention across 10 MDR-TB hospitals in South Africa. RESULT(S): The adjusted hazard of AG regimen modification due to ototoxicity in the high-dose group (>=75 mg/kg/week) was 1.33 times higher than in the low-dose group (,75 mg/kg/week, 95%CI 1.09-1.64). The adjusted hazard of developing audiometric hearing loss was 1.34 times higher than in the low-dose group (95%CI 1.01-1.77). Pre-existing hearing loss (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.71, 95%CI 1.29-2.26) and age (aHR 1.16 per 10 years of age, 95%CI 1.01-1.33) were also associated with an increased risk of hearing loss. CONCLUSION(S): MDR-TB patients with high AG dose, advanced age and pre-existing hearing loss have a significantly higher risk of AG-induced hearing loss.

In older adults, such interactions may be affected, especially in those individuals who have more severe age-related hearing loss. Using a data-driven approach, we assessed the temporal (when in time) and spatial (where in the brain) characteristics of cortical speech-evoked responses that distinguish older adults with or without mild hearing loss. We performed source analyses to estimate cortical surface signals from the EEG recordings during a phoneme discrimination task conducted under clear and noise-degraded conditions. We computed source-level ERPs (i.e., mean activation within each ROI) from each of the 68 ROIs of the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas, averaged over a randomly chosen 100 trials without replacement to form feature vectors. We adopted a multivariate feature selection method called stability selection and control to choose features that are consistent over a range of model parameters. We use parameter optimized support vector machine (SVM) as a classifiers to investigate the time course and brain regions that segregate groups and speech clarity. For clear speech perception, whole-brain data revealed a classification accuracy of 81.50% [area under the curve (AUC) 80.73%; F1-score 82.00%], distinguishing groups within ~60 ms after speech onset (i.e., as early as the P1 wave). We observed lower accuracy of 78.12% [AUC 77.64%; F1-score 78.00%] and delayed classification performance when speech was embedded in noise, with group segregation at 80 ms. Separate analysis using left (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) regions showed that LH speech activity was better at distinguishing hearing groups than activity measured in the RH. Moreover, stability selection analysis identified 12 brain regions (among 1428 total spatiotemporal features from 68 regions) where source activity segregated groups with >80% accuracy (clear speech); whereas 16 regions were critical for noise-degraded speech to achieve a comparable level of group segregation (78.7% accuracy). Our results identify critical time-courses and brain regions that distinguish mild hearing loss from normal hearing in older adults and confirm a larger number of active areas, particularly in RH, when processing noise-degraded speech information.© Copyright © 2020 Mahmud, Ahmed, Al-Fahad, Moinuddin, Yeasin, Alain and Bidelman.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2020.00748,SFX,

A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is a method for deep learning (DL). It has a powerful ability to automatically extract features and is widely used in classification tasks with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the small number of samples and low signal-to-noise ratio involved in scalp EEG with low spatial resolution constitute a limitation that might restrict potential brain-computer interface (BCI) applications that are based on the CNN model. In the present study, a novel CNN model with source-spatial feature images (SSFIs) as the input is proposed to decode auditory attention tracking states in a cocktail party environment. Approach. We first extract SSFIs using rhythm entropy and weighted minimum norm estimation. Next, we develop a CNN model with three convolutional layers. Furthermore, we estimate the performance of the proposed model via generalized performance, alternative models that deleted or replaced a model's component, and loss curves. Finally, we use a deep transfer model with fine-tuning for a low (poor) behavioral performance group (L-group). Main results. Based on cortical activity reconstructions from the scalp EEGs, the classification accuracy (CA) of the proposed model is 80.4% (chance level: 52.5%), which is superior to that achieved by scalp EEG. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is more stable when compared to alternative models that delete or replace specific model components. The proposed model identifies the difference between two auditory attention tracking states (successful versus unsuccessful) at an early stage with a short time window (250 ms after target offset). Furthermore, we propose a deep transfer learning model to improve the classification for the L-group. With this model, the CA of the L-group significantly increase by 5.3%. Significance. Our proposed model improves the performance of a decoder for auditory attention tracking, which could be suitable for relieving the difficulty with the attentional modulation of individual's neural responses. It provides a novel communication channel with auditory cognitive BCI for patients with attention and hearing impairment.Copyright © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1088%2f1741-2552%2fab92b2,SFX,32403093 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32403093]

Functional studies have revealed connectivity pattern changes in the tinnitus brains that suggested a change of network dynamics as well as topological organization. However, no studies have yet provided evidence for the topological network changes in the gray matter. In this research, we aim to use the graph-theoretical approach to investigate the changes of topology in the tinnitus brain using structural MRI data, which could provide insights into the underlying anatomical basis for the neural mechanism in generating phantom sounds. Method(s): We collected 3D MRI images on 46 bilateral tinnitus patients and 46 age and gender-matched healthy controls. Brain networks were constructed with correlation matrices of the cortical thickness and subcortical volumes of 80 cortical/subcortical regions of interests. Global network properties were analyzed using local and global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-world coefficient, and regional network properties were evaluated using the betweenness coefficient for hub connectivity, and interregional correlations for edge properties. Between-group differences in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were assessed using independent sample t-tests, and local efficiency, global efficiency, clustering coefficient, sigma, and interregional correlation were compared using non-parametric permutation tests. Result(s): Tinnitus was found to have increased global efficiency, local efficiency, and cluster coefficient, indicating generally heightened connectivity of the network. The small-world coefficient remained normal for tinnitus, indicating intact small-worldness. Betweenness centrality analysis showed that hubs in the amygdala and parahippocampus were only found for tinnitus but not controls. In contrast, hubs in the auditory cortex, insula, and thalamus were only found for controls but not tinnitus. Interregional correlation analysis further found in tinnitus enhanced connectivity between the auditory cortex and prefrontal lobe, and decreased connectivity of the insula with anterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampus. Conclusion(s): These findings provided the first morphological evidence of altered topological organization of the brain networks in tinnitus. These alterations suggest that heightened efficiency of the brain network and altered auditory-limbic connection for tinnitus, which could be developed in compensation for the auditory deafferentation, leading to overcompensation and, ultimately, an emotional and cognitive burden.© Copyright © 2020 Lin, Chen, Wang, Song, Lin, Yuan, Liu, Yang and Jiang.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2020.00541,SFX,

The modulation stems from the theta- but not the delta-band portion of the speech envelope, and likely reflects the entrainment of neural activity in the theta frequency band, which may aid the parsing of the speech stream. The influence of the current stimulation on speech comprehension can vary with the time delay between the current waveform and the audio signal. While this effect has been investigated for current stimulation based on the entire speech envelope, it has not yet been measured when the current waveform follows the theta-band portion of the speech envelope. Here, we show that transcranial current stimulation with the speech envelope filtered in the theta frequency band improves speech comprehension as compared to a sham stimulus. The improvement occurs when there is no time delay between the current and the speech stimulus, as well as when the temporal delay is comparatively short, 90 ms. In contrast, longer delays, as well as negative delays, do not impact speech-in-noise comprehension. Moreover, we find that the improvement of speech comprehension at no or small delays of the current stimulation is consistent across participants. Our findings suggest that cortical entrainment to speech is most influenced through current stimulation that follows the speech envelope with at most a small delay. They also open a path to enhancing the perception of speech in noise, an issue that is particularly important for people with hearing impairment.© Copyright © 2020 Keshavarzi and Reichenbach.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.3389%2ffnhum.2020.00187,SFX,

Lesion measurement based on structural damage may label partly damaged but functional tissue as abnormal, and moreover, ignores distant dysfunction in structurally intact tissue caused by deafferentation, diaschisis, and other processes. A reliable method to map functional integrity of tissue throughout the brain would provide a valuable new approach to measuring lesions. Here, we use machine learning on four dimensional resting state fMRI data obtained from left-hemisphere stroke survivors in the chronic period of recovery and control subjects to generate graded maps of functional anomaly throughout the brain in individual patients. These functional anomaly maps identify areas of obvious structural lesions and are stable across multiple measurements taken months and even years apart. Moreover, the maps identify functionally anomalous regions in structurally intact tissue, providing a direct measure of remote effects of lesions on the function of distant brain structures. Multivariate lesion-behavior mapping using functional anomaly maps replicates classic behavioral localization, identifying inferior frontal regions related to speech fluency, lateral temporal regions related to auditory comprehension, parietal regions related to phonology, and the hand area of motor cortex and descending corticospinal pathways for hand motor function. Further, this approach identifies relationships between tissue function and behavior distant from the structural lesions, including right premotor dysfunction related to ipsilateral hand movement, and right cerebellar regions known to contribute to speech fluency. Brain-wide maps of the functional effects of focal lesions could have wide implications for lesion-behavior association studies and studies of recovery after brain injury.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2020.116806,SFX,32278896 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32278896]

In this study, we successfully created zebrafish mariner mutants by targeting the motor head domain of Myo7aa using CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants showed unbalanced swimming behavior and disorganized sterocilia of inner ear hair cells, which resemble the phenotype of the zebrafish mariner mutants. In addition, we found that CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants have reduced number of stereociliary bundles of inner ear hair cells and have significant hearing loss. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis was performed on F0 larvae within the first week post fertilization, which dramatically shortens data collection period.

In a CI surgery, an electrode array is inserted into the cochlea to stimulate auditory nerves. After surgery, CIs need to be programmed. Studies have shown that the cochlea-electrode spatial relationship derived from medical images can guide CI programming and lead to significant improvement in hearing outcomes. We have developed a series of algorithms to segment the inner ear anatomy and localize the electrodes. But, because clinical head CT images are acquired with different protocols, the field of view and orientation of the image volumes vary greatly. As a consequence, visual inspection and manual image registration to an atlas image are needed to document their content and to initialize intensity-based registration algorithms used in our processing pipeline. For large-scale evaluation and deployment of our methods these steps need to be automated. In this article we propose to achieve this with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be trained end-to-end to classify a head CT image in terms of its content and to localize landmarks. The detected landmarks can then be used to estimate a point-based registration with the atlas image in which the same landmark set's positions are known. We achieve 99.5% classification accuracy and an average localization error of 3.45 mm for 7 landmarks located around each inner ear.

However, no reliable audiometric hallmarks are available for counselling the hearing recovery possibility. Aims/objectives: To find parameters for predicting MD hearing outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): We applied machine learning techniques to analyse transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) signals recorded from patients with MD. Thirty unilateral MD patients were recruited prospectively after onset of acute cochleo-vestibular symptoms. Serial TEOAE and pure-tone audiogram (PTA) data were recorded longitudinally. Denoised TEOAE signals were projected onto the three most prominent principal directions through a linear transformation. Binary classification was performed using a support vector machine (SVM). TEOAE signal parameters, including signal energy and group delay, were compared between improved (PTA improvement: >=15 dB) and nonimproved groups using Welch's t-test. Result(s): Signal energy did not differ (p =.64) but a significant difference in 1-kHz (p =.045) group delay was recorded between improved and nonimproved groups. The SVM achieved a cross-validated accuracy of >80% in predicting hearing outcomes. Conclusions and significance: This study revealed that baseline TEOAE parameters obtained during acute MD episodes, when processed through machine learning technology, may provide information on outer hair cell function to predict hearing recovery.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1080%2f00016489.2019.1704865,SFX,32003266 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=32003266]

These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases. Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies. No cure is available for most heritable white matter disorders but symptomatic treatments can significantly decrease the burden of events. New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population. Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.

This study investigated differences in automatic and executive lexical-semantic processes on verbal fluency tasks in individuals with acquired hearing loss. The primary outcomes were indices of automatic (clustering/word retrieval at start of task) and executive (switching/word retrieval after start of the task) processes from semantic and phonemic fluency tasks. To extract indices of clustering and switching, we used both manual and computerised methods. There were no differences between groups on indices of executive fluency processes or on any indices from the semantic fluency task. The hearing loss group demonstrated weaker automatic processes on the phonemic fluency task.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Recognize that Herpes Zoster can present with polycranial neuritis. CASE: A 37 year-old-female presented with a painful, burning rash on the left face that spread to the oropharynx over the course of three days. Associated symptoms include dysgeusia, otalgia, vertigo, headache, and pain with opening her jaw. She denied fatigue, night sweats, fevers, weight loss, hearing loss, or ocular symptoms. On exam, she was afebrile with normal vital signs and appeared uncomfortable. There was a vesicular rash on the left external auditory canal, auricle, cheek, chin, and lower lip. Ulcerations were present on the left tongue, soft palate and anterior tonsillar pillar that did not cross midline. There was no ocular involvement. A left-sided facial nerve palsy and cervical lymphadenopathy were noted. Labs noted lymphopenia, globulin gap, and HIV positivity with a CD4 count of 54 (normal >500). Maxillofacial CT revealed parotid lymphoepithelial lesions and nasopharyngeal abscess superimposed on a herpes zoster (HZ) cluster. She was diagnosed with HZ with polycranial involvement (cranial nerves V and VII) in the setting of newly diagnosed Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Treatments included IV acyclovir, prednisone, empiric antibiotics for the abscess not amenable to drainage, cortisporin otic drops, and supportive care. She was started on bictegravir/emtricitabine/ tenofovir as acute retroviral syndrome could not be ruled out. The patient clinically improved and was discharged with close follow-up. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (HZ Oticus) classically presents with HZ reactivation involving the facial nerve with ipsilateral facial palsy and rash in the ear and mouth. HZ can also involve the trigeminal nerve. The ophthalmic branch is most commonly affected; the maxillary and mandibular branches are rarely involved. Here we describe a rare presentation of HZ with polycranial involvement of both the facial and the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. Patients with HZ should be monitored closely for development of ocular involvement which is associated with significant morbidity. Other complications of HZ include abscess formation as varicella infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infection as seen in this patient. Another important point is that this patient initially presented to an outside hospital and was diagnosed with HZ; however, her globulin gap was not evaluated and her HIV status was not assessed. In this case, why would a young patient present with Herpes Zoster with a globulin gap and parotid lympoepithelial lesions? Immunodeficiency must be considered and recognition will result in earlier diagnosis with improved outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): HIV status should be assessed in patients presenting with Herpes Zoster, a globulin gap, or lymphoepithelial lesions. Herpes Zoster can present with polycranial neuritis and timely treatment is essential to decrease morbidity.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1007%2fs11606-020-05890-3,SFX,

Lee J.-H.",,,SAGE Publications Inc.,"Objectives: Recently, brain plasticity across modalities during deafness has been reported as being associated with individual outcomes. However, many are from cross-sectional or case studies, whereas longitudinal observation in multiple patients is scarce. Therefore, we developed a prediction system using machine learning based on cross-modal plasticity in a longitudinal study with multiple subjects. We sought to develop electroencephalography biomarkers for evaluating and predicting outcomes after cochlear implantation (CI). Method(s): Classification of patients with excellent or good outcome was based on the features of brain cross-modal plasticity measured using auditory, visual, and tactile event-related responses and their corresponding electromagnetic sources. Prediction accuracy, sensitivity/specificity, total error cost, and training time were compared among conditions and machine learning estimation model is based on linear supervised training. Result(s): Twelve data sets were collected from 4 patients. More effective classification between excellent and good outcome was possible with the combined features of sensor-level latency and sources. Specifically, the tactile feature was found to be a factor that best explains CI outcome (accuracy 89%, sensitivity 91, specificity 87, total error cost 2), followed by visual feature (accuracy 78%, sensitivity 76, specificity 72, error cost 4). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that cross-modal brain plasticity due to deafness would provide a basis for classifying the status and prognosis of the CI users.

Pertinent physical exam findings included noisy breathing, cupped ear, micrognathia, prominent forehead, mouth with downturned corners, small penis, and decreased tone for age. An NG tube could not be passed through either nasal passage. The patient underwent fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy which revealed bilateral choanal atresia. Stents were subsequant placement. An MRI of the IAC revealed absence of CNs VII and VIII as well as IAC atresia, absence of the lateral and posterior semicircular canals, and incomplete separation of the cochlear apparatus. A comprehensive ABR showed profound SN hearing loss. Karyotype resulted 46, XY, and the patient's aneuploidy panel and state NBS were normal. The patient fulfilled the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome based on the clinical criteria. Findings consistent with the syndrome included: choanal atresia, CNs VII and VIII anomalies, genital hypoplasia, malformed internal and external ear, decreased tone, short stature, and prominent forehead. Molecular analysis of the CHD7 gene was performed which revealed a heterozygous missense variant, c.5243 T>C (p. Leu1748Pro). The patient's mother and father were not carriers of this variant, confirming de novo origin. This variant has not previously been published and is currently classified as a VUS; however, in-silico analyses support a deleterious effect. CHARGE syndrome is a multiorgan malformation syndrome, first described in 1979. The 'CHARGE' mnemonic was coined as a way to memorably summarize the original cluster of features, including C-coloboma, H-heart disease, Aatresia of the choanae, R-retarded growth and development, G-genital hypoplasia, and E-ear anomalies or deafness. CDH7 was established as the major causative gene in the syndrome in 2004. Most known pathogenic CHD7 variants are truncating nonsense and frameshift variants, and while there are reports of pathogenic missense variants, they represent only a small percentage of the known pathogenic variants.

Study Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Method(s): Nine UVFP patients treated by type I thyroplasty, and 11 control subjects were compared using magnetoencephalographic imaging to measure beta band (12-30 Hz) neural oscillations during voice production with perturbation of pitch feedback. Differences in beta band power relative to baseline were analyzed to identify cortical areas with abnormal activity within the 400 ms perturbation period and 125 ms beyond, for a total of 525 ms. Result(s): Whole-brain task-induced beta band activation patterns were qualitatively similar in both treated UVFP patients and healthy controls. Central vocal motor control plasticity in UVFP was expressed within constitutive components of central human communication networks identified in healthy controls. Treated UVFP patients exhibited statistically significant enhancement (P < 0.05) in beta band activity following pitch perturbation onset in left auditory cortex to 525 ms, left premotor cortex to 225 ms, and left and right frontal cortex to 525 ms. Conclusion(s): This study further corroborates that a peripheral motor impairment of the larynx can affect central cortical networks engaged in auditory feedback processing, vocal motor control, and judgment of voice-as-self. Future research to dissect functional relationships among constitutive cortical networks could reveal neurophysiological bases of central contributions to voice production impairment in UVFP.

The use of cochlear implants (CIs) may affect auditory categorization and result in poor abilities. The current study was designed to compare how children with normal hearing (NH) and children with CIs categorize a set of everyday sounds. We tested 24 NH children and 24 children with CI on a free-sorting task of 18 everyday sounds corresponding to four a priori categories: nonlinguistic human vocalizations, environmental sounds, musical sounds, and animal vocalizations. Multiple correspondence analysis revealed considerable variation within both groups of child listeners, although the human vocalizations and musical sounds were similarly categorized. In contrast to NH children, children with CIs categorized some sounds according to their acoustic content rather than their associated semantic information. These results show that despite identification deficits, children with CIs are able to categorize environmental and vocal sounds in a similar way to NH children, and are able to use categorization as an adaptive process when dealing with everyday sounds.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1038%2fs41598-019-39991-9,SFX,30837546 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30837546]

This included the validation of the new short-form on an independent sample and an in-depth, comparative analysis of all existing, full and short SSQ forms. DESIGN: Data from a previous study involving 98 normal-hearing (NH) individuals and 196 people with hearing impairments (HI), non hearing aid wearers, along with results from several other published SSQ studies, were used for developing the short-form. Data from a new and independent sample of 35 NH and 88 HI hearing aid wearers were used to validate the new short-form. Factor and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to check the factor structure and internal consistency of the new short-form. In addition, the new short-form was compared with all other SSQ forms, including the full SSQ, the German SSQ15, the SSQ12, and the SSQ5. Construct validity was further assessed by testing statistical relationships between scores and audiometric factors, including pure-tone threshold averages (PTAs) and left/right PTA asymmetry. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to compare the ability of different SSQ forms to discriminate between NH and HI (HI non hearing aid wearers and HI hearing aid wearers) individuals. RESULT(S): Compared all other SSQ forms, including the full SSQ, the new short-form showed negligible cross-loading across the three main subscales and greater discriminatory power between NH and HI subjects (as indicated by a larger area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve), as well as between the main subscales (especially Speech and Qualities). Moreover, the new, 5-item Spatial subscale showed increased sensitivity to left/right PTA asymmetry. Very good internal consistency and homogeneity and high correlations with the SSQ were obtained for all short-forms. CONCLUSION(S): While maintaining the three-factor structure of the full SSQ, and exceeding the latter in terms of construct validity and sensitivity to audiometric variables, the new 15-item SSQ affords a substantial reduction in the number of items and, thus, in test time. Based on overall scores, Speech subscores, or Spatial subscores, but not Qualities subscores, the 15-item SSQ appears to be more sensitive to differences in self-evaluated hearing abilities between NH and HI subjects than the full SSQ.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000675,SFX,30461444 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30461444]

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cerumen impaction and associated factors among primary school children in Mwanza City and to assess the effect of cerumen impaction and its removal on hearing ability Methods and Patients: This was a cross-sectional, community based study of primary school children with cerumen impaction that was carried out in randomly selected primary schools in Mwanza City between December 2016 and May 2017. Multistage cluster sampling technique was employed to obtain a required number of the study population. Result(s): Out of the 406 participants, ninety-five (23.4%) had cerumen impacted in their ears. Of these, 56 (58.9%) were males and 39(41.1%) were females. The mean age at presentation was 11.24+/-8.86 years. Ear bud abuse (83.7%) was the most common predisposing factor for cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction was found in the right ear of 9 (9.5%) patients and in the left ear in 31 (32.6%) patients and bilateral in 55 (57.9%) of patients. The major presenting symptoms were ear itching, otalgia, hearing loss and tinnitus. Ear syringing was used to remove cerumen impaction and caused significant improvement in hearing thresholds. There were no recorded complications. Conclusion(s): Cerumen impaction is a common otologic presentation in our sub-region. Ignorance with the profound abuse of cotton buds is the major predisposing factor. Health education is of the essence as treatment is simple and effective.Copyright © 2019, National Institute for Medical Research.

In vivo electrophysiological studies have shown that transient visual deprivation (dark exposure, DE) in adult mice improves the frequency selectivity and discrimination of neurons in thalamorecipient layer 4 (L4) of primary auditory cortex (A1). Since sound information is processed hierarchically in A1 by populations of neurons, we investigated whether DE alters network activity in A1 L4 and layer 2/3 (L2/3). We examined neuronal populations in both L4 and L2/3 using in vivo two-photon calcium (Ca2+) imaging of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s. We find that one week of DE in adult mice increased the sound evoked responses and frequency selectivity of both L4 and L2/3 neurons. Moreover, after DE the frequency representation changed with L4 and L2/3 showing a reduced representation of cells with best frequencies (BFs) between 8 and 16 kHz and an increased representation of cells with BFs above 32 kHz. Cells in L4 and L2/3 showed decreased pairwise signal correlations (SCs) consistent with sharper tuning curves. The decreases in SCs were larger in L4 than in L2/3. The decreased pairwise correlations indicate a sparsification of A1 responses to tonal stimuli. Thus, cross-modal experience in adults can both alter the sound-evoked responses of A1 neurons and change activity correlations within A1 potentially enhancing the encoding of auditory stimuli.Copyright © 2019 Solarana et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1523%2fENEURO.0269-19.2019,SFX,31744840 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31744840]

Inclusion criteria were patients > 18 years of age, SSNHL diagnosed within 4 previous weeks, completed steroid treatment, and complete documentation. Results There were 30 patients (55%) that showed significant improvement in their pure-tone audiogram (PTA) hearing threshold average (>= 15 dB) after steroid treatment. Two-step cluster analysis identified 3 clusters based on average PTA hearing threshold recovery and average Measure of Perceived Stress scores. The difference between pretreatment and posttreatment hearing levels was significantly higher in the cluster with moderate stress compared to clusters with mild and high stress levels (Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman test, p < .001).

The authors have combined these capabilities into an online (i.e., web-based) pure-tone audiogram estimator intended to empower researchers and clinicians with advanced hearing tests without the need for custom programming or special hardware. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of this new online machine learning audiogram method relative to a commonly used hearing threshold estimation technique also implemented online for the first time in the same platform. DESIGN: The authors performed air conduction pure-tone audiometry on 21 participants between the ages of 19 and 79 years (mean 41, SD 21) exhibiting a wide range of hearing abilities. For each ear, two repetitions of online machine learning audiogram estimation and two repetitions of online modified Hughson-Westlake ascending-descending audiogram estimation were acquired by an audiologist using the online software tools. The estimated hearing thresholds of these two techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8kHz). RESULT(S): The two threshold estimation methods delivered very similar threshold estimates at standard audiogram frequencies. Specifically, the mean absolute difference between threshold estimates was 3.24+/-5.15 dB. The mean absolute differences between repeated measurements of the online machine learning procedure and between repeated measurements of the Hughson-Westlake procedure were 2.85+/-6.57 dB and 1.88+/-3.56 dB, respectively. The machine learning method generated estimates of both threshold and spread (i.e., the inverse of psychometric slope) continuously across the entire frequency range tested from fewer samples on average than the modified Hughson-Westlake procedure required to estimate six discrete thresholds. CONCLUSION(S): Online machine learning audiogram estimation in its current form provides all the information of conventional threshold audiometry with similar accuracy and reliability in less time. More importantly, however, this method provides additional audiogram details not provided by other methods. This standardized platform can be readily extended to bone conduction, masking, spectrotemporal modulation, speech perception, etc., unifying audiometric testing into a single comprehensive procedure efficient enough to become part of the standard audiologic workup.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000669,SFX,30358656 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30358656]

Five hundred and fifty-five ears from 380 patients (3,770 test samples) diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were analyzed. A threshold-equalizing noise (TEN) test was applied to detect the presence of DRs. Data were collected on sex, age, side of the affected ear, hearing loss etiology, word recognition scores (WRS), and pure-tone thresholds at each frequency. According to the cause of hearing loss as diagnosed by the physician, we categorized the patients into six groups: 1) SNHL with unknown etiology; 2) sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL); 3) vestibular schwannoma (VS); 4) Meniere's disease (MD); 5) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); or 6) presbycusis or age-related hearing loss (ARHL). To develop a predictive model, we performed recursive partitioning and regression for classification, logistic regression, and random forest. The overall prevalence of one or more DRs in test ears was 20.36% (113 ears). Among the 3,770 test samples, the overall frequency-specific prevalence of DR was 6.7%. WRS, pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, disease type (VS or MD), and frequency information were useful for predicting DRs. Sex and age were not associated with detecting DRs. Based on these results, we suggest possible predictive factors for determining the presence of DRs. To improve the predictive power of the model, a more flexible model or more clinical features, such as the duration of hearing loss or risk factors for developing DRs, may be needed.Copyright © 2019 Chang et al.

DESIGN: Audiometric and noise exposure data were collected on a population of screened workers (N = 1,113) from 17 factories located in Zhejiang province, China. All the subjects were exposed to complex noise. Each subject was given an otologic examination to determine their pure-tone hearing threshold levels and had their personal full-shift noise recorded. For each subject, the hearing loss was evaluated according to the hearing impairment definition of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Age, exposure duration, equivalent A-weighted SPL (LAeq), and median kurtosis were used as the input for four machine learning algorithms, that is, support vector machine, neural network multilayer perceptron, random forest, and adaptive boosting. Both classification and regression models were developed to predict noise-induced hearing loss applying these four machine learning algorithms. Two indexes, area under the curve and prediction accuracy, were used to assess the performances of the classification models for predicting hearing impairment of workers. Root mean square error was used to quantify the prediction performance of the regression models. RESULT(S): A prediction accuracy between 78.6 and 80.1% indicated that the four classification models could be useful tools to assess noise-induced hearing impairment of workers exposed to various complex occupational noises. A comprehensive evaluation using both the area under the curve and prediction accuracy showed that the support vector machine model achieved the best score and thus should be selected as the tool with the highest potential for predicting hearing impairment from the occupational noise exposures in this study.

METHOD(S): A population-based prevalence survey of hearing impairment was undertaken in 2014. Fifty-one clusters of 80 people aged 6 months and older were selected using probability-proportionate-to-size sampling. A two-stage hearing screening was conducted using otoacoustic emissions on all participants followed by pure-tone audiometry on those aged 4 years and older who failed otoacoustic emissions. Cases of hearing impairment were defined using the World Health Organization definition of disabling hearing impairment: a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of >=41 dB HL for adults and >=31 dB HL for children based on the better ear. Possible causes of hearing impairment were ascertained by a certified audiologist. Reported hearing difficulties were also measured in this survey and compared with audiometry results. RESULT(S): Three thousand five hundred seventy-three people were examined (response rate 87%), of whom 52% were female. The prevalence of disabling hearing impairment was 4.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8 to 5.3). Disabling hearing impairment prevalence increased with age from 0.4% in those aged 4 to 17 years (95% CI = 0.2 to 1.1) to 34.7% (95% CI = 28.7 to 41.1) in those aged older than 65 years. No difference in prevalence was seen by sex. Ear examination suggested that the possible cause of disabling hearing impairment was chronic suppurative otitis media for 6.9% of cases and dry perforation for 5.6% cases. For the vast majority of people with disabling hearing impairment, a possible cause could not be established. The overall prevalence of reported or proxy reported hearing impairment was 2.6% (95% CI = 2.0 to 3.4), and this ranged from 0.6% (95% CI = 0.08 to 4.4) in those aged 0 to 3 years to 14.4% (95% CI = 9.8 to 20.7) in those aged older than 65 years. CONCLUSION(S): Disabling hearing impairment in Telangana State is common, affecting approximately 1 in 23 people overall and a third of people aged older than 65 years.

(Meyer) Tinnituszentrum, Charite - Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany",Elsevier B.V.,"To date, research examining the relationship between brain structure and hearing acuity is sparse, especially given the context of a broad age range. To investigate this relationship, we applied an automated surface-based morphometry (SBM) approach (FreeSurfer) in this study to re-examine a sample of normal-hearing (n = 17) and hearing-impaired (n = 17) age- and education-matched adults, aged between 20 and 63 years (Alfandari et al., 2018). The SBM approach allows the disentanglement of cortical surface area (CSA) from cortical thickness (CT), the 2 independent constituents of cortical volume (CV). We extend the findings of Alfandari and colleagues by showing several clusters in auditory-related areas as well as in the left and right angular gyrus that showed reduced CT, CSA and CV in hearing-impaired compared to normal-hearing listeners. Nevertheless, none of the clusters found correlated significantly with hearing acuity, measured by pure-tone thresholds, in the 2 groups. An additional vertex-wise correlation analysis between hearing acuity and morphometric parameters over all participants revealed a single significant cluster encompassing the left Heschl's gyrus. Higher hearing thresholds were associated with a thinner cortex within this cluster. Our results imply that hearing impairment is associated with reduced thickness in primary and secondary auditory cortex regions, those regions especially involved in perceiving and processing relevant speech cues. This decrease was observed not only in older but also in younger and middle-aged adults, independent of age-related decline in the cognitive domain and age-dependent whole-brain atrophy. Further, the results show the value added when considering CV, CT and CSA separately, relative to previous studies which have solely relied on voxel-based morphometry to investigate brain structure and hearing acuity across the lifespan.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2019.107823,SFX,31678891 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31678891]

(E-mail: apjcs@harcourt.com),"The study of deaf and hearing native users of signed languages can offer unique insights into how biological constraints and environmental input interact to shape the neural bases of language processing. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address two questions: (1) Do semantic and syntactic processing in a signed language rely on anatomically and functionally distinct neural substrates as it has been shown for spoken languages? and (2) Does hearing status affect the neural correlates of these two types of linguistic processing? Deaf and hearing native signers performed a sentence judgement task on German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebardensprache: DGS) sentences which were correct or contained either syntactic or semantic violations. We hypothesized that processing of semantic and syntactic violations in DGS relies on distinct neural substrates as it has been shown for spoken languages. Moreover, we hypothesized that effects of hearing status are observed within auditory regions, as deaf native signers have been shown to activate auditory areas to a greater extent than hearing native signers when processing a signed language. Semantic processing activated low-level visual areas and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), suggesting both modality-dependent and independent processing mechanisms. Syntactic processing elicited increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Moreover, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed a cluster in left middle occipital regions showing increased functional coupling with the right SMG during syntactic relative to semantic processing, possibly indicating spatial processing mechanisms that are specific to signed syntax. Effects of hearing status were observed in the right superior temporal cortex (STC): deaf but not hearing native signers showed greater activation for semantic violations than for syntactic violations in this region. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the neural correlates of language processing are partly determined by biological constraints, but that they may additionally be influenced by the unique processing demands of the language modality and different sensory experiences.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2019.06.025,SFX,31220577 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31220577]

Identification of different patient subgroups with distinct audiological, psychophysical, and neurophysiological characteristics will facilitate the management of patients with tinnitus as well as the design and execution of drug development and clinical trials, which, for the most part, have not yielded conclusive results. An alternative outcome of a precision medicine approach in tinnitus would be that additional mechanistic phenotyping might not lead to the identification of distinct drivers in each individual, but instead, it might reveal that each individual may display a quantitative blend of causal factors. Therefore, a precision medicine approach towards identifying these causal factors might not lead to subtyping these patients but may instead highlight causal pathways that can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and no matter what the final outcome is, a mechanistic-driven precision medicine approach is a win-win approach for advancing tinnitus research and treatment. Although there are several controversies and inconsistencies in the tinnitus field, which will not be discussed here, we will give a few examples, as to how the field can move forward by exploring the major neurophysiological tinnitus models, mostly by taking advantage of the common features supported by all of the models. Our position stems from the central concept that, as a field, we can and must do more to bring studies of mechanisms into the realm of neuroscience.Copyright © 2019, Association for Research in Otolaryngology.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1007%2fs10162-018-00709-9,SFX,30825037 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30825037]

While the state mandates school hearing screening, many children with hearing loss are not identified or are lost to follow-up before ever receiving treatment. A robust, tribally owned healthcare system exists in Alaska, but children with hearing loss must first be identified and referred for existing infrastructure to be used. This trial will evaluate a new school hearing screening and referral process in rural Alaska, with the goal of improving timely identification and treatment of childhood hearing loss. Methods and analysis: Comparative effectiveness community randomised trial testing digital innovations to improve school hearing screening and referral in 15 communities in the Norton Sound region of northwest Alaska, with data collection from October 2017 to February 2020. All children (K-12) attending school in Bering Strait School District with parental informed consent and child assent will be eligible (target recruitment n=1500). Participating children will undergo both the current school hearing screen and new mobile health (mHealth) screen, with screening test validity evaluated against an audiometric assessment. Communities will be cluster randomised to continue the current primary care referral process or receive telemedicine referral for follow-up diagnosis and treatment. The primary outcome will be time to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, ear/hearing diagnosis from screening date, measured in days. Secondary outcomes will include: sensitivity and specificity of current school and mHealth screening protocols measured against a benchmark audiometric assessment (air and bone conduction audiometry, tympanometry and digital otoscopy); hearing loss prevalence; hearing-related quality of life; and school performance (AIMSweb).

Method(s): Prospective collection of 84 patients with untreated SSHL were recruited from the otolaryngology department of the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology between June 2013 to May 2015 as the SSHL group. Meanwhile, a total of 63 healthy volunteers who were no any ear disease history, and the hearing function were confirmed with pure tone audiometry, were collected as the control group. All subjects underwent a brain DTI scan. The data were divided into the training set and validation set according to the ratio of 7 to 3, that was, the training set contained 58 cases of SSHL patients and 44 control groups, and the validation set included 26 cases of SSHL patients and 19 control groups. A vector which included the DTI parameters such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity was constructed with the software R. The LASSO regression of machine learning method was used to perform feature dimensionality reduction and construct a classification model. The training set samples were used to map the nomogram based on the multivariate logistic analysis method, the validation set and the AUC were used to evaluate the prediction ability of the nomogram, and the calibration curve was used to evaluate the model. Result(s): From the 200 feature vectors including the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values of each brain region, after each dimension reduction process, a total of six features were retained, which were the MD of left superior corona radiate and right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the AD of the body of corpus callosum, and the RD of left inferior cerebellar peduncle, left superior corona radiate and right posterior limb of internal capsule. The six features of patients with unilateral SSHL were higher than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Based on this, a two-class model is constructed and a nomogram is drawn. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of the training set were 93.1% (54/58), 72.7% (32/44), 84.3% (86/102) and 0.854, respectively; the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC of validation set were 80.8% (21/26), 84.2% (16/19), 82.2% (37/45), 0.870, respectively. Nomogram could significantly improve the classification efficiency of the control group and patients, and the model with the LASSO method showed a higher prediction curve than other models. Conclusion(s): The machine learning classification model based on DTI metrics can effectively distinguish patients with unilateral sudden sensorineural deafness from healthy control people.Copyright © 2019 by the Chinese Medical Association.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.3760%2fcma.j.issn.1005-1201.2019.09.010,SFX,

The proband was a 13-year-old boy with congenital non-syndromic sensorineural deafness. At 3 year old, he developed progressive distal weakness of all limbs with muscle atrophy of both hands and shanks. Nerve conduction study revealed the loss of sensory nerve action potentials, and slowing down of motor nerve conduction velocities with a decrease of amplitudes of compound motor action potentials. Visual evoked potentials and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were not bilaterally evocable. Sural biopsy proved the loss of myelinated nerve fibers, with axonal degeneration, regenerating clusters and onion bulbs.

The interface of the ear with digital technology to remediate hearing loss, or as a consumer device within an intelligent ecosystem of connected devices, is receiving enormous creative energy. Automation and artificial intelligence can enhance otological medical and surgical practice.

Older adults' poorer speech-in-noise (SIN) comprehension has been related to abnormal neural representations within various nodes (regions) of the speech network, but how senescent changes in hearing alter the transmission of brain signals remains unspecified. We measured electroencephalograms in older adults with and without mild hearing loss during a SIN identification task. Using functional connectivity and graph-theoretic analyses, we show that hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have more extended (less integrated) communication pathways and less efficient information exchange among widespread brain regions (larger network eccentricity) than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Parameter optimized support vector machine classifiers applied to EEG connectivity data showed hearing status could be decoded (> 85% accuracy) solely using network-level descriptions of brain activity, but classification was particularly robust using left hemisphere connections. Notably, we found a reversal in directed neural signaling in left hemisphere dependent on hearing status among specific connections within the dorsal-ventral speech pathways. NH listeners showed an overall net ""bottom-up"" signaling directed from auditory cortex (A1) to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; Broca's area), whereas the HI group showed the reverse signal (i.e., ""top-down"" Broca's -> A1). A similar flow reversal was noted between left IFG and motor cortex.

During these periods both intrinsic and extrinsic pathological factors can hamper development. These time points are not available for the human cochlear nucleus (CN). We have used design-based stereology and determined that 18-22 weeks of gestation (WG) are critical in the development of the human CN. Twenty-three fetuses and seven postnatal brainstems were processed for cresyl violet (CV) staining and immunoexpression of NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Ki-67 (proliferation) and TUNEL (apoptosis) and 3-D reconstruction. The volume of CN, total number of neurons selected profiles and the volume of neurons and their nuclei were estimated. Data were grouped (G) into: G1:18-20 WG, G2: 21-24 WG, G3: 25-28 WG and G4 >29 WG. The dimensions of morphologically identified neurons were also measured. The CN primordium was first identifiable at 10WG. Definitive DCN (Dorsal cochlear nucleus) and VCN (ventral cochlear nucleus) were identifiable at 16 WG. There was a sudden growth spurt in total volume of CN, number of neurons and astrocytes from 18 WG. We also observed an increase in proliferation and apoptosis after 22 WG. The number of neurons identifiable by CV was significantly lower than that by NeuN-immunostaining till 25 WG (p = 0.020), after which, both methods were equivalent. Eight morphological types of neurons were identifiable by 26 WG and could be resolved into four clusters by volume and diameter. The CN changed orientation from small, flat and horizontal at 10-16 WG to larger and oblique from 18WG onwards. Prevention of exposure to noxious factors at 18-22 WG may be important in preventing congenital deafness.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2019.107784,SFX,31522073 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31522073]

However, the excitotoxic mechanisms are unknown, and the necessity of glutamate for synapse loss or regeneration is unclear. Despite absence of glutamatergic transmission from cochlear inner hair cells in mice lacking the vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (Vglut3KO), at 9-11 weeks, approximately half the number of synapses found in Vglut3WT were maintained as postsynaptic AMPA receptors juxtaposed with presynaptic ribbons and voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV1.3). Synapses were larger in Vglut3KO than Vglut3WT. In Vglut3WT and Vglut3+/- mice, 8-16 kHz octave-band noise exposure at 100 dB sound pressure level caused a threshold shift (~40 dB) and a loss of synapses (>50%) at 24 h after exposure. Hearing threshold and synapse number partially recovered by 2 weeks after exposure as ribbons became larger, whereas recovery was significantly better in Vglut3WT. Noise exposure at 94 dB sound pressure level caused auditory threshold shifts that fully recovered in 2 weeks, whereas suprathreshold hearing recovered faster in Vglut3WT than Vglut3+/-. These results, from mice of both sexes, suggest that spontaneous repair of synapses after noise depends on the level of Vglut3 protein or the level of glutamate release during the recovery period. Noise-induced loss of presynaptic ribbons or postsynaptic AMPA receptors was not observed in Vglut3KO, demonstrating its dependence on vesicular glutamate release. In Vglut3WT and Vglut3+/-, noise exposure caused unpairing of presynaptic ribbons and presynaptic CaV1.3, but not in Vglut3KO where CaV1.3 remained clustered with ribbons at presynaptic active zones. These results suggest that, without glutamate release, noise-induced presynaptic Ca2+ influx was insufficient to disassemble the active zone. However, synapse volume increased by 2 weeks after exposure in Vglut3KO, suggesting glutamate-independent mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hearing depends on glutamatergic transmission mediated by Vglut3, but the role of glutamate in synapse loss and repair is unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we show that one copy of the Vglut3 gene is sufficient for noise-induced threshold shift and loss of ribbon synapses, but both copies are required for normal recovery of hearing function and ribbon synapse number. Impairment of the recovery process in mice having only one functional copy suggests that glutamate release may promote synapse regeneration. At least one copy of the Vglut3 gene is necessary for noise-induced synapse loss. Although the excitotoxic mechanism remains unknown, these findings are consistent with the presumption that glutamate is the key mediator of noise-induced synaptopathy.Copyright © 2019 the authors.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1523%2fJNEUROSCI.2228-18.2019,SFX,30926748 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30926748]

The primary purpose of this systematic review was to explore the COPD-based alteration in the auditory system function by conducting a quantitative analysis of presently published data. Material(s) and Method(s): We systematically searched seven diverse electronic databases and manual searching of references to identify relevant studies. Data from the selected studies were rated by two investigators independently in a blinded fashion. Meta-analysis was done on pooled data using Cochrane's Review Manager 5.3. Result(s): Sixteen articles received suitable scores and were thus included for further processes. Hearing loss (HL) was defined as a change in pure tone audiometry (PTA) thresholds, auditory brainstem response (ABR), and auditory P300 parameters. ABR wave was significantly elongated in patients with COPD than in controls (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.27, 95% CI: 0.05-0.48, P=0.02). PTA was significantly higher in patients with COPD when compared with controls (SMD=1.76, 95% CI: 0.43-3.08, P=0.0004). We found that patients with COPD had a significantly higher latency than controls (SMD=1.30, 95% CI: 0.79-1.80, P=0.0001). Conclusion(s): COPD patients had considerably greater incidence of HL when compared with controls. Interestingly, although the mean PTA thresholds at every frequency for COPD patients were higher than those for controls, these values were still in the slight to mild HL ranges. Prolonged ABR wave latencies in the COPD patients suggest retro-cochlear involvement. Thus, COPD most frequently clusters with HL, but it is worth noting that alteration in hearing is not always recognized by medical experts as a frequent comorbidity associated with COPD.Copyright © 2019 Bayat et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.2147%2fCOPD.S182730,SFX,30643401 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30643401]

We sought to develop a prediction model of AG-induced hearing loss among patients initiating DR-TB treatment in South Africa. Method(s): We nested this analysis within a cluster randomized trial of nurse-led case management in 10 South African TB hospitals. All participants >=13 years old received kanamycin or amikacin. We performed clinical and audiometric evaluations at treatment initiation. Hearing loss was defined as a poorer hearing threshold compared to baseline. We developed the model using data from 265 patients at hearing frequencies from 250Hz to 8kHz and validated the model using data from 114 separate patients at both 250Hz-8kHz and ultrahigh frequencies (9-16kHz). We estimated standardized weekly AG exposure as: {prescribed daily AG dose (mg) x frequency of dosing per week} weight (kg). Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression were used for multivariable adjustment. Result(s): Of 936 participants, 54% were male; mean age was 36 years; and 75% were HIV coinfected at baseline. Comparing patients with high (>=75 mg/ kg/week) versus low (<75 mg/kg/week) AG exposure, the adjusted hazard (aHR) of regimen cessation due to ototoxicity was 1.33 (p=0.006), and for audiometric hearing loss was 1.34 (p=.038). Baseline hearing loss (aHR=1.71, p<.001) and age (aHR=1.02, p=.031) were also associated with increased hazard of hearing loss. Predictors of ototoxicity in the final prediction model included: standardized weekly AG exposure, HIV status, CD4 count, age, serum albumin, BMI, and baseline hearing loss. This model demonstrated moderate discrimination (AUC=0.72) and good calibration (chi2[8]=6.10, p=.64) at normal frequencies and better discrimination (AUC=0.81) at ultrahigh frequencies that might represent early manifestations of AG ototoxicity. Discrimination for AG regimen cessation due to ototoxicity (among 671 patients without baseline audiometric data) was weaker (AUC=0.60). Using a cutoff of 85% predicted probability of hearing loss, the positive predictive value was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 41%. Conclusion(s): This model identifies patients at high risk for AG-induced hearing loss and may inform clinical guidelines regarding which patients to prioritize for injectable-free regimens.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&AN=634220823,SFX,

Linkage analysis in clusters of pedigrees sharing a DSM diagnoses or phenotype have largely not replicated. Transcriptome and genome wide association studies using many tens-of-thousands of cases have successfully led to hundreds of risk loci; however, the significant loci have low effect size. Perhaps no risk genes with large effect size are causal in psychiatric genetics, i.e., all are highly polygenic. Yet, it is puzzling why all other branches of medicine have found many Mendelian genes associated with disease. In fact, early discovery of such genes played pivotal roles in the initial understanding of the pathophysiology of many common disorders (e.g., dyslipidemia, thalassemia, and other inborn errors of metabolism). Another interpretation is the heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders precludes finding rare Mendelian genes when many distinct diseases under a DSM rubric are lumped together at a syndromal level. Recently, linkage analyses of single consanguineous pedigrees afflicted by a variety of disorders are finding rare variants with large effect sizes associated with disorders providing candidate genes for further study (Rilstone et al., NEJM 2013; Alkuraya et al., 2010) However, because these genes are so rare, causal evidence requires convergent approaches such as molecular dissection within cellular pathways and interactome, 3D modeling, animal models, and directed therapeutics. Method(s): Human Subjects: A Pakistani consanguineous pedigree consisted of two healthy parents who were first cousins and seven offspring. One child died early. Two girls had psychosis with auditory hallucinations and delusions consistent with DSM schizophrenia with onset at ages ~15 and 23 years. The older girl had the more severe affliction. These girls had no history of substance abuse, major affective illness, or intellectual disability. The other children were psychiatrically well. All provided informed consent. The MINI was used as a screener. Blood was collected and processed for DNA sequencing. DNA analysis: Whole exome capture used the Agilent SureSelect v5 system. The DNA was sequenced on the Novaseq 6000 with 150 bp paired-end reads. Coverage was 100 fold. Homozygosity mapping used Agilevcfmapper. Allele specific PCR was used to determine polymorphism in the local population. Risk gene identification: The criteria used to identify target variants follows: 1) it should be exonic; 2) its linkage should be consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance; 3) the gene should be rare (MAF < 0.01) given negative selection pressure; 4) it should be completely conserved; 5) it should not show polymorphism in the local population; 6) the variant should be pathogenic based on conservation and current predictive tools for structual impact scores; 7) it should not be homozygous in databases of normal subjects. Result(s): There were three large homozygous regions located on chromosomes 4, 12, and 15 in the affected sisters. Only the homozygous region on chromosome 4 contained an exonic variant which affected an amino acid conserved in evolution in all vertebrate species examined and was predicted to be pathogenic by all six software packages used. Only the homozygous region in chromosome 4 (111-128.6 Mb, hg19) showed the correct linkage. The variant linked to the psychosis phenotype localized to Chr:4-120181668 (hg19), in exon 10 of USP53 (NM-019050.2); c.682T > C; p.(Cys228Arg) at 4q26. Conclusion(s): This allele's frequency in South Asians is 5.2(10)-5 (gnomAD) without individuals homozygous for the variant. The variant was not polymorphic in the local population. Given the rarity, it is unlikely this variant will be found in another family. The functions of USP53 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 53) are not entirely clear. It is a nonprotease homolog of the ubiquitin peptidase family expected to be cytoplasmic. It is expressed at low to medium levels in mouse and human brain. The human immunohistochemistry remains to be clarified. A knockout in mice is associated with deafness and abnormalities of the tight junction (Kazmierczak et al., 2015). Two interacting partners (CRKL, DAB2) are positioned in the reelin pathway thought important in the neurodevelopment of schizophrenia. Another partner is BLMH, a homocysteine-thiolactone hydrolase. Homocysteine has been implicated in schizophrenia and has motivated treatment trials with folic acid and vitamin B12 (Roffman et al., 2013). Abnormalities of the ubiquitin proteasome have also been identified in schizophrenia (Kim et al., 2018). Limitations of this study include the following: 1) pathogenic copy number variants or non-coding variants were not addressed; 2) limited generalizability in explaining most psychotic illness or the population risk for psychosis; and 3) lack of direct evidence for causality. Given the rarity of the variant, such evidence will require convergent findings in elucidating the biology of USP53 in the brain using molecular and cell biology techniques and their clinical translation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1038%2fs41386-019-0545-y,SFX,

Method(s): We investigated 9780 noise-exposed workers from 2012 to 2018. Interviews and audiology examinations were conducted and the total noise exposure was calculated. Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, was adopted to predict NIHL with 6 risk factors. We defined those with good actual hearing thresholds (AHT) but were predicted to be bad as the resistance group, and, those with bad AHT but were predicted to be well as the susceptible group. The behavioral tests (speech in noise, competing sentences, dichotic listening) and objective tests (ABR, ECochG, event-related potential, MMN) were recorded to evaluate auditory processing abilities. Result(s): 5365 workers were comprised in this study (4554 male, 811 female). Audiology changes of 530 workers within 5 years showed the most susceptible frequency of NIHL arise in 12 kHz. Females had better hearing than males after adjusted for confounders. The best predictive ability of RF achieved an accuracy of 69%. The age, career length and CNE of the susceptible group were all lower while the AHT were obviously greater than that of the resistant group. The exposed subjects in noise group with normal EHF and abnormal EHF showed no difference in sound detection sensitivity compared with the control, but they showed significantly deteriorated signal processing ability in various behavior tests. Conclusion(s): 12 kHz may be the most sensitive frequency to noise rather than 4KHz. Individual susceptibility to NIHL is different, female is more resistant. More sensitive tests could detect hidden hearing loss, which provide evidences to emphasize the contribution of auditory brain to the processing disorders.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1055%2fs-0039-1686551,SFX,

Zai A.",,"(Hahnloser, Zai) ETH Zurich, Zurich 1972, Switzerland",Elsevier Ltd,"Our lab is interested in identifying principles of natural intelligence using vocal behaviors in songbirds as a model system. One of the most compelling computational approaches to intelligence is the reinforcement learning framework. Reinforcement learning has been widely studied in birds using brief auditory or visual stimuli applied during singing. When such stimuli are applied contingently on the pitch of one of the bird's song syllables, for example during low-pitched renditions of a syllable, birds tend to avoid the stimuli by increasing the pitch of just that syllable. I will present our ongoing work of identifying the simplest descriptive model that can fully account of birds' complex pitching strategies. Current reinforcement learning models are unable to account for the observation that birds are repelled by a stimulus in some situation and attracted by it in another. In particular, normally, birds tend to avoid pitch-contingent light off in their cage. However, our work shows that when deafened, birds change their song to increase the rate of light-off events. To account for this apparent value inversion (of light off) induced by deafening, we suggest an intrinsic motivation of birds to increase entropy. According to this principle, birds tend to choose actions that let them experience a maximally rich sensory world. We argue that our simple binary framework, deaf birds subjected to just two lighting conditions, is an ideal experimental setting for testing theories of motor exploration, which are of high interest in artificial intelligence where they are known as policies, but for which little is known in higher animalsCopyright © 2019",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.ibror.2019.07.155,SFX,

Demonstrate improvement in SP with the use of a visual speech recognition program (VSRP). Method(s): A prospective study involving 10 NH and 4 HL individuals was conducted from September 2018 to January 2019. Participants were situated in a sound-isolated booth facing a speaker through a window. In non-VSRP condition, SP was evaluated on 24 Bamford-Kowal-Bench Speech-in-Noise test (BKB-SIN) sentences presented by the speaker at 50 A-weighted decibels (dBA) with multiperson babble noise presented at 70 or 75 dBA. SP was defined as the percentage of correct words identified. In VSRP conditions, a video camera was used to track the speaker's lips during speech in realtime. Lip movement data were translated into speech-text via a novel artificial intelligence-based VSRP. SP was evaluated in the same way as in the non-VSRP condition on 26 BKB-SIN sentences, with the addition of the output of the VSRP presented on a screen to the listener. Result(s): In the non-VSRP condition, NH listeners achieved significantly higher SP than HL listeners (39.5% vs 26.6%, P = .038). With VSRP, NH listeners were significantly more accurate (75.9% vs 39.5%, P < .0001), as were HL listeners (71.6% vs 21.6%, P = .006). With VSRP, no significant difference was observed in SP between NH and HL listeners (75.9% vs 71.6%, P = .45).

Assistive hearing devices cannot lower interfering speakers without knowing which speaker the listener is focusing on. One possible solution is auditory attention decoding in which the brainwaves of listeners are compared with sound sources to determine the attended source, which can then be amplified to facilitate hearing. In realistic situations, however, only mixed audio is available. We utilize a novel speech separation algorithm to automatically separate speakers in mixed audio, with no need for the speakers to have prior training. Our results show that auditory attention decoding with automatically separated speakers is as accurate and fast as using clean speech sounds. The proposed method significantly improves the subjective and objective quality of the attended speaker.

Here, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to measure the sensitivity of layer II/III neurons in mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) to interaural level differences (ILDs), the principal spatial cue in this species. Although most ILD-sensitive neurons preferred ILDs favoring the contralateral ear, neurons with either midline or ipsilateral preferences were also present. An opponent-channel decoder accurately classified ILDs using the difference in responses between populations of neurons that preferred contralateral-ear-greater and ipsilateral-ear-greater stimuli. We also examined the spatial organization of binaural tuning properties across the imaged neurons with unprecedented resolution. Neurons driven exclusively by contralateral ear stimuli or by binaural stimulation occasionally formed local clusters, but their binaural categories and ILD preferences were not spatially organized on a more global scale. In contrast, the sound frequency preferences of most neurons within local cortical regions fell within a restricted frequency range, and a tonotopic gradient was observed across the cortical surface of individual mice. These results indicate that the representation of ILDs in mouse A1 is comparable to that of most other mammalian species, and appears to lack systematic or consistent spatial order.Copyright © The Author 2017.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1093%2fcercor%2fbhx295,SFX,29136122 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29136122]

Moderate-to-moderately severe hearing loss can usually be corrected with hearing aids; however, severe-to-profound hearing loss often requires a cochlear implant (CI). However, post-operative CI results vary, and the performance of the previous prediction models is limited, indicating that a new approach is needed. For postlingually deaf adults (nde120) who received CI with full insertion, we predicted CI outcomes using a Random-Forest Regression (RFR) model and investigated the effect of preoperative factors on CI outcomes. Postoperative word recognition scores (WRS) served as the dependent variable to predict. Predictors included duration of deafness (DoD), age at CI operation (ageCI), duration of hearing-aid use (DoHA), preoperative hearing threshold and sentence recognition score. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient r between the true WRS and predicted WRS. The fitting using a linear model resulted in prediction of WRS with r=0.7 and MAE=15.6+/-9. RFR outperformed the linear model (r=0.96, MAE=6.1+/-4.7, p<0.00001). Cross-hospital data validation showed reliable performance using RFR (r=0.91, MAE=9.6+/-5.2). The contribution of DoD to prediction was the highest (MAE increase when omitted: 14.8), followed by ageCI (8.9) and DoHA (7.5). After CI, patients with DoD<10 years presented better WRSs and smaller variations (p<0.01) than those with longer DoD. Better WRS was also explained by younger age at CI and longer-term DoHA. Machine learning demonstrated a robust prediction performance for CI outcomes in postlingually deaf adults across different institutes, providing a reference value for counseling patients considering CI. Health care providers should be aware that the patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss who cannot have benefit from hearing aids need to proceed with CI as soon as possible and should continue using hearing aids until after CI operation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1038%2fs41598-018-36404-1,SFX,30573747 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30573747]

DISCUSSION: This objective approach to identifying candidates has the potential to address the gross underutilization of CIs by removing any bias or lack of knowledge regarding the management of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with CIs. CONCLUSION(S): The screening module was an effective tool for identifying potential CI candidates at one ENT practice. On a larger scale, the screening module has the potential to impact thousands of CI candidates worldwide.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1080%2f14670100.2018.1425274,SFX,29347892 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29347892]

Accordingly, this study sought to create a new scale that is reliable, valid, brief, and easy to score with the purpose of filling this gap. DESIGN: Original items were constructed through review of currently existing models of hyperacusis measurement, as well as qualitative data collected from professional audiologists and individuals reporting heightened audiological sensitivity with tinnitus. An initial 26-item scale yielded sound reliability and validity properties. Refinement based on review of initial data resulted in a 25-question second version with a maximum score of 100. A total of 450 completed survey protocols were analyzed from 469 refined Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS) administrations collected online, representing individuals from 37 countries with a mean age of 34.8 years. RESULT(S): Internal consistency reliability analysis yielded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.93, indicating excellent reliability. Furthermore, the IHS showed sound convergent validity with established measures of quality of life, anxiety, and depression in bivariate correlation analysis of Pearson's r. Factor analysis revealed a dimensional structure containing five factors, which were designated psychosocial impact, emotional arousal, functional impact, general loudness, and communication. Analysis of variance between perceived global hyperacusis severity categories provided a preliminary framework for scoring thresholds. Although the level of hearing loss did not correlate with IHS scores, increased tinnitus symptoms were a significant factor in predicting hyperacusis distress and severity. CONCLUSION(S): These initial results demonstrated sound statistical properties of the IHS and usefulness as a hyperacusis measurement tool in research and clinical practice. Factor structure and scale dimensions allow for differentiation between subtypes of loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain based on responses to clusters of specific items within the dimensional factor structure of the scale, and may thus prove useful in clinical practice and research.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000583,SFX,29742543 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29742543]

However, the perceptual consequences of hearing loss are typically associated not only with a loss of sensitivity but also with a loss of clarity that is not captured by the audiogram. A detailed characterization of a hearing loss may be complex and needs to be simplified to efficiently explore the specific compensation needs of the individual listener. Here, it is hypothesized that any listener's hearing profile can be characterized along two dimensions of distortion: Type I and Type II. While Type I can be linked to factors affecting audibility, Type II reflects non-audibility-related distortions. To test this hypothesis, the individual performance data from two previous studies were reanalyzed using an unsupervised-learning technique to identify extreme patterns in the data, thus forming the basis for different auditory profiles. Next, a decision tree was determined to classify the listeners into one of the profiles. The analysis provides evidence for the existence of four profiles in the data. The most significant predictors for profile identification were related to binaural processing, auditory nonlinearity, and speech-in-noise perception. This approach could be valuable for analyzing other data sets to select the most relevant tests for auditory profiling and propose more efficient hearing-deficit compensation strategies.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1177%2f2331216518807400,SFX,30384803 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30384803]

The second objective was to develop a set of prototype listening situations (PLSs) that describe the speech level, noise level, SNR, availability of visual cues, and locations of speech and noise sources of typical speech listening situations experienced by these individuals. DESIGN: Twenty older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss carried digital recorders for 5 to 6 weeks to record sounds for 10 hours per day. They also repeatedly completed in situ surveys on smartphones several times per day to report the characteristics of their current environments, including the locations of the primary talker (if they were listening to speech) and noise source (if it was noisy) and the availability of visual cues. For surveys where speech listening was indicated, the corresponding audio recording was examined. Speech-plus-noise and noise-only segments were extracted, and the SNR was estimated using a power subtraction technique. SNRs and the associated survey data were subjected to cluster analysis to develop PLSs. RESULT(S): The speech level, noise level, and SNR of 894 listening situations were analyzed to address the first objective. Results suggested that as noise levels increased from 40 to 74 dBA, speech levels systematically increased from 60 to 74 dBA, and SNR decreased from 20 to 0 dB. Most SNRs (62.9%) of the collected recordings were between 2 and 14 dB. Very noisy situations that had SNRs below 0 dB comprised 7.5% of the listening situations. To address the second objective, recordings and survey data from 718 observations were analyzed. Cluster analysis suggested that the participants' daily listening situations could be grouped into 12 clusters (i.e., 12 PLSs). The most frequently occurring PLSs were characterized as having the talker in front of the listener with visual cues available, either in quiet or in diffuse noise. The mean speech level of the PLSs that described quiet situations was 62.8 dBA, and the mean SNR of the PLSs that represented noisy environments was 7.4 dB (speech = 67.9 dBA). A subset of observations (n = 280), which was obtained by excluding the data collected from quiet environments, was further used to develop PLSs that represent noisier situations. From this subset, two PLSs were identified. These two PLSs had lower SNRs (mean = 4.2 dB), but the most frequent situations still involved speech from in front of the listener in diffuse noise with visual cues available. CONCLUSION(S): The present study indicated that visual cues and diffuse noise were exceedingly common in real-world speech listening situations, while environments with negative SNRs were relatively rare. The characteristics of speech level, noise level, and SNR, together with the PLS information reported by the present study, can be useful for researchers aiming to design ecologically valid assessment procedures to estimate real-world speech communicative functions for older adults with hearing loss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000486,SFX,29466265 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29466265]

It is now widely accepted that early implantation leads to better postimplant outcomes. Although some generalizations can be made about postimplant auditory and language performance, neural mechanisms need to be studied to predict individual prognosis. Purpose(s): The aim of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify preimplant neuroimaging biomarkers that predict children's postimplant auditory and language outcomes as measured by parental observation/reports. Research Design: This is a pre-post correlational measures study. Study Sample: Twelve possible cochlear implant candidates with bilateral severe to profound hearing loss were recruited via referrals for a clinical magnetic resonance imaging to ensure structural integrity of the auditory nerve for implantation. Intervention(s): Participants underwent cochlear implantation at a mean age of 19.4 mo. All children used the advanced combination encoder strategy (ACE, Cochlear Corporation, Nucleus Freedom cochlear implants). Three participants received an implant in the right ear; one in the left ear whereas eight participants received bilateral implants. Participants' preimplant neuronal activation in response to two auditory stimuli was studied using an event-related fMRI method. Data Collection and Analysis: Blood oxygen level dependent contrast maps were calculated for speech and noise stimuli. The general linear model was used to create z-maps. The Auditory Skills Checklist (ASC) and the SKI-HI Language Development Scale (SKI-HI LDS) were administered to the parents 2 yr after implantation. A nonparametric correlation analysis was implemented between preimplant fMRI activation and postimplant auditory and language outcomes based on ASC and SKI-HI LDS. Statistical Parametric Mapping software was used to create regression maps between fMRI activation and scores on the aforementioned tests. Regression maps were overlaid on the Imaging Research Center infant template and visualized in MRIcro. Result(s): Regression maps revealed two clusters of brain activation for the speech versus silence contrast and five clusters for the noise versus silence contrast that were significantly correlated with the parental reports. These clusters included auditory and extra-auditory regions such as the middle temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, subgyral, and middle occipital gyrus. Both positive and negative correlations were observed. Correlation values for the different clusters ranged from 20.90 to 0.95 and were significant at a corrected p value of,0.05. Correlations suggest that postimplant performance may be predicted by activation in specific brain regions.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Audiology.

Despite the high prevalence of hearing loss, substantial gaps in the utilization of amplification options, including hearing AIDS and cochlear implants (CI), have been identified. Objective(s): To investigate the contemporary prevalence, characteristics, and patterns of specialty referral, evaluation, and treatment of hearing difficulty among adults in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A cross-sectional analysis of responses from a nationwide clustered representative sample of adults who participated in the 2014 National Health Interview Survey and responded to the hearing module questions was carried out. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data regarding demographics aswell as self-reported hearing status, functional hearing, laterality, onset, and primary cause of the hearing loss were collected. In addition, specific data regarding hearing-related clinician visits, hearing tests, referrals to hearing specialist, and utilization of hearing AIDS and CIs were analyzed. Result(s): Among 239.6 million adults, 40.3 million (16.8%) indicated their hearing was less than ""excellent/good,"" ranging from ""a little trouble hearing"" to ""deaf."" The mean (SD) age of participants was 47 (0.2) years with 48.2%being men and 51.8%women. Approximately 48.8 million (20.6%) had visited a physician for hearing problems in the preceding 5 years. Of these, 32.6%were referred to an otolaryngologist and 27.3%were referred to an audiologist. Functional hearing was reported as the ability to hear ""whispering"" or ""normal voice"" (225.4 million; 95.5%), to ""only hear shouting"" (8.0 million; 3.4%), and ""not appreciating shouting"" (2.8 million; 1.1%). Among the last group, 5.3%were recommended to have a CI, of which 22.1% had received one. Of the adults who indicated their hearing from ""a little trouble hearing"" to being ""deaf,"" 12.9 million (32.2%) had never seen a clinician for hearing problems and 11.1 million (28.0%) had never had their hearing tested. Conclusions and Relevance: There are considerable gaps between self-reported hearing loss and patients receiving medical evaluation and recommended treatments for hearing loss.

To understand the neurobiological basis of this variability, we used presurgical neural morphological data obtained from MRI of individual pediatric cochlear implant (CI) candidates implanted younger than 3.5 years to predict variability of their speech-perception improvement after surgery. We first compared neuroanatomical density and spatial pattern similarity of CI candidates to that of age-matched children with normal hearing, which allowed us to detail neuroanatomical networks that were either affected or unaffected by auditory deprivation. This information enables us to build machine-learning models to predict the individual children's speech development following CI. We found that regions of the brain that were unaffected by auditory deprivation, in particular the auditory association and cognitive brain regions, produced the highest accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in patient classification and the most precise prediction results. These findings suggest that brain areas unaffected by auditory deprivation are critical to developing closer to typical speech outcomes.

(McGinnity, Coleman) Intelligent Systems Research Centre, University of Ulster, Londonderry BT487JL, United Kingdom",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Tinnitus is a problem that affects a diverse range of people. One common trait amongst people with tinnitus is the presence of hearing loss, which is apparent in over 90% of the cohort. It is postulated that the remainder of people with tinnitus have hidden hearing loss in the form of cochlear synaptopathy. The loss of hearing sensation is thought to cause a reduction in the bottom-up excitatory signals of the auditory pathway leading to a change in the frequency of thalamocortical oscillations known as thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD). The downward shift in oscillatory behavior, characteristic of TCD, has been recorded experimentally but the underlying mechanisms responsible for TCD in tinnitus subjects cannot be directly observed. This paper investigates these underlying mechanisms by creating a biologically faithful model of the auditory periphery and thalamocortical network, called the central auditory processing (CAP) model. The proposed model replicates tinnitus related activity in the presence of hearing loss and hidden hearing loss in the form of cochlear synaptopathy. The results of this paper show that, both the bottom-up and top-down changes are required in the auditory system for tinnitus related hyperactivity to coexist with TCD, contrary to the theoretical model for TCD. The CAP model provides a novel modeling approach to account for tinnitus related activity with and without hearing loss. Moreover, the results provide additional clarity to the understanding of TCD and tinnitus and provide direction for future approaches to treating tinnitus.Copyright © 2018 IEEE.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1109%2fTNSRE.2018.2863740,SFX,30106678 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30106678]

Here, we have identified a novel pathogenic variant in HOMER2 in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant, non-syndromic hearing loss. This is the second family reported globally with hearing loss caused by a variant in HOMER2. The pathogenic variant c.840_841insC in HOMER2 (NM_199330), segregating with the hearing-loss phenotype in the family, leads to a premature stop codon producing a truncated protein. The coiled-coil domain in the C-terminal of HOMER2 protein is essential for protein multimerization and HOMER2-CDC42 interaction. We compared the phenotypes in the two families and found that hearing impairment in this Chinese family was more severe. Furthermore, we found that the ability of this insertion mutant type HOMER2 (HOMER2MU) to multimerize decreased more significantly than wild-type HOMER2 (HOMER2WT) and the reported c.554G>C (NM_004839) mutant HOMER2. HOMER2MU protein tended to be distributed in a diffuse manner, whereas HOMER2WT and the reported mutant HOMER2 tended to cluster together. Our research provides a validating second family for variants in HOMER2 causing non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.

In each of these models, synaptopathy begins prior to changes in threshold sensitivity or loss of hair cells; thus, this underlying injury can be hidden behind a normal threshold audiogram. Since cochlear synaptic loss cannot be directly confirmed in living humans, non-invasive assays will be required for diagnosis. In animals with normal auditory thresholds, the amplitude of wave 1 of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is highly correlated with synapse counts. However, synaptopathy can also co-occur with threshold elevation, complicating the use of the ABR alone as a diagnostic measure. Using an age-graded series of mice and a partial least squares regression approach to model structure-function relationships, this study shows that the combination of a small number of ABR and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements can predict synaptic ribbon counts at various cochlear frequencies to within 1-2 synapses per IHC of their true value. In contrast, the model, trained using the age-graded series of mice, overpredicted synapse counts in a small sample of young noise-exposed mice, perhaps due to differences in the underlying pattern of damage between aging and noise-exposed mice. These results provide partial validation of a noninvasive approach to identify synaptic/neuronal loss in humans using ABRs and DPOAEs.Copyright © 2018",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2018.10.006,SFX,30366194 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30366194]

Fe-S clusters proteins are involved in enzymatic catalysis and gene expression, mito-chondrial respiration, DNA replication, DNA repair, and iron homeosta-sis. Recently, FDXR defects have been shown to cause a novel mitochon-drial disease with auditory neuropathy and optic atrophy. Methods/case report: Eight affected individuals from six families were included in the study. Clinical examination, muscle biopsy investigations, biochemical and molecular analyses, including Sanger/whole exome (WES)/WES trios sequencing and Western blot were performed. Result(s): Ten FDXR pathogenic variants including nine novel ones were revealed. The clinical presentation in these individuals is varied, and includes families with more severe phenotypes than previously described. Early-onset progressive leukoencephalopathy and brain atrophy, Leigh syndrome, and medullary and cerebellar atrophy are reported in three families. Visual and hearing impairment, in keeping with the previously described phenotype in FDXR defects, is reported in four of five investigated families. Functional tests performed in two available fibroblast cell lines confirmed reduction in the FDXR protein level on Western blot. Discussion(s): Our study contribute to the further delineation of molecular and clinical spectrum related to FDRX defects.

Studies suggest that established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors may contribute to the pathophysiology of the inner ear. However, the aggregate effect of CVD risk factors on hearing is not well understood. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that high CVD risk burden is associated with worse hearing. Method(s): We assessed younger (ages 18-34) and older (ages 55-64) Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants who underwent audiometry in 2008-11. After excluding those with conductive pathology and asymmetric HL, we randomly chose one ear for analysis. Puretone thresholds were obtained at 0.5-8 kHz; puretone average (PTA) was calculated using thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Low CVD risk burden was defined as having all of: blood pressure (BP) <120/<80 mmHg; total cholesterol <180 mg/dL; not currently smoking; and not having prevalent diabetes. High CVD risk burden was defined as >= 2 of: diabetes; currently smoking; BP >160/>100 mmHg (or antihypertensive use); and total cholesterol >240 mg/dL (or statin use). By age group and sex, we estimated hearing thresholds per frequency with linear regression models adjusted for noise exposure. Least squares estimates were calculated using strata-specific means of covariates. Estimates were compared via t-tests. Data were weighted for all analyses and accounted for clustering. Result(s): Among younger and older individuals in the target population (51.9% female), 28.8% had low and 5.5% had high CVD risk. Younger men with high CVD risk had worse PTA than young men with low risk (7.7 dB HL [7.0-8.4] vs. 10.5 dB HL [8.4-12.5], p=0.02), and had significantly worse thresholds at 1,3,4,6 kHz than those with low risk (Figure). There was no difference in PTA or thresholds at any frequency by CVD risk burden in young women, older men, or older women. Conclusion(s): CVD risk burden is associated with HL among young men, but not young women or older adults. CVD risk burden may be useful for identifying young men at risk for HL.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&AN=621615631,SFX,

FADE uses a simple automatic speech recognizer (ASR) to estimate the lowest achievable speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from simulated speech recognition experiments in an objective way, independent from any empirical reference data. Empirical data from the literature were used to evaluate the model in terms of predicted SRTs and benefits in SRT with the German matrix sentence recognition test when using eight single- and multichannel binaural noise-reduction algorithms. To allow individual predictions of SRTs in binaural conditions, the model was extended with a simple better ear approach and individualized by taking audiograms into account. In a realistic binaural cafeteria condition, FADE explained about 90% of the variance of the empirical SRTs for a group of normal-hearing listeners and predicted the corresponding benefits with a root-mean-square prediction error of 0.6dB. This highlights the potential of the approach for the objective assessment of benefits in SRT without prior knowledge about the empirical data. The predictions for the group of listeners with impaired hearing explained 75% of the empirical variance, while the individual predictions explained less than 25%. Possibly, additional individual factors should be considered for more accurate predictions with impaired hearing. A competing talker condition clearly showed one limitation of current ASR technology, as the empirical performance with SRTs lower than -20dB could not be predicted.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1177%2f2331216518768954,SFX,29692200 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29692200]

Processing of degraded speech is associated with different patterns of brain activity in comparison with that of high-quality speech. In this exploratory study, we studied whether processing degraded auditory input in daily life because of hearing impairment is associated with differences in brain volume. We compared T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images of 17 hearing-impaired (HI) adults with those of 17 normal-hearing (NH) controls using a voxel-based morphometry analysis. HI adults were individually matched with NH adults based on age and educational level. Gray and white matter brain volumes were compared between the groups by region-of-interest analyses in structures associated with speech processing, and by whole-brain analyses. The results suggest increased gray matter volume in the right angular gyrus and decreased white matter volume in the left fusiform gyrus in HI listeners as compared with NH ones. In the HI group, there was a significant correlation between hearing acuity and cluster volume of the gray matter cluster in the right angular gyrus. This correlation supports the link between partial hearing loss and altered brain volume. The alterations in volume may reflect the operation of compensatory mechanisms that are related to decoding meaning from degraded auditory input.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1177%2f2331216518763689,SFX,29557274 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29557274]

The potential benefits of using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for reducing wind noise were assessed. The RNN was trained using recordings of the output of the two microphones of a behind-the-ear hearing aid in response to male and female speech at various azimuths in the presence of noise produced by wind from various azimuths with a velocity of 3m/s, using the ""clean"" speech as a reference. A paired-comparison procedure was used to compare all possible combinations of three conditions for subjective intelligibility and for sound quality or comfort. The conditions were unprocessed noisy speech, noisy speech processed using the RNN, and noisy speech that was high-pass filtered (which also reduced wind noise). Eighteen native English-speaking participants were tested, nine with normal hearing and nine with mild-to-moderate hearing impairment. Frequency-dependent linear amplification was provided for the latter. Processing using the RNN was significantly preferred over no processing by both subject groups for both subjective intelligibility and sound quality, although the magnitude of the preferences was small. High-pass filtering (HPF) was not significantly preferred over no processing. Although RNN was significantly preferred over HPF only for sound quality for the hearing-impaired participants, for the results as a whole, there was a preference for RNN over HPF. Overall, the results suggest that reduction of wind noise using an RNN is possible and might have beneficial effects when used in hearing aids.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1177%2f2331216518770964,SFX,29708061 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29708061]

Objective(s): The aims of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of an asynchronous telehealth-based service delivery model using automated technology for screening and diagnostic testing as well as to describe the prevalence, type and degree of hearing loss. Method(s): A comparative within-subject design was used. Frequency distributions, sensitivity, specificity scores as well as the positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Testing was conducted in a non-sound-treated classroom within a school environment on 73 participants (146 ears). The sensitivity and specificity rates were 65.2% and 100%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was 91.7% and the negative predictive values (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) were 93.8% and 100%, respectively. Result(s): Results revealed that 23 ears of 20 participants (16%) presented with hearing loss. Twelve per cent of ears presented with unilateral hearing impairment and 4% with bilateral hearing loss. Mild hearing loss was identified as most prevalent (8% of ears). Eight ears obtained false-negative results and presented with mild low- to mid-frequency hearing loss. The sensitivity rate for the study was low and was attributed to plausible reasons relating to test accuracy, child-related variables and mild low-frequency sensory-neural hearing loss. Conclusion(s): The study demonstrates that asynchronous telehealth-based automated hearing testing within the school context can be used to facilitate early identification of hearing loss; however, further research and development into protocol formulation, ongoing device monitoring and facilitator training is required to improve test sensitivity and ensure accuracy of results.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.4102%2fsajcd.v65i1.582,SFX,30035608 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30035608]

The associated conductive hearing loss is a major concern for hearing health professionals. The aim of the present study was to describe the configuration of pure tone audiograms of children with OME and to design a statistical stratification algorithm to facilitate hearing loss profiling in children with OME.
METHODS: School age children with OME were recruited. Bone and air conduction thresholds were obtained using standard procedures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to determine audiometric profile groups. The Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test was used to measure sentence perception in children for cluster analysis validity assessment.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven children (164 ears) aged between 72 months and 153 months were examined. Air conduction thresholds averaged for 500Hz, 1000Hz and 2000Hz were in the range of 8.3-53.3dB HL with a mean of 26.8dB HL. Bone conduction thresholds were found to be influenced by middle ear pathology with a maximal elevation at 2000Hz of 25dB HL. Four audiometric profiles were identified. Cluster 1 contained 54 ears (32.9%) with normal or near normal hearing, Clusters 2 contained 37 ears (22.6%) with mild hearing loss, Cluster 3 included 48 ears (29.3%) and Cluster 4 included 25 ears (15.2%) with moderate hearing loss. Stability and validity of the four-cluster profiling procedure was examined and established with satisfactory results.
CONCLUSIONS: OME in children is associated with pure tone hearing thresholds ranging from normal to moderate hearing loss. The hierarchical clustering algorithm proved useful as a novel means of profiling hearing loss in children with OME and may assist in identifying affected children at greater risk of auditory disadvantage. Implications for rehabilitation A hierarchical cluster analysis method can be used to determine audiometric profiles in children with OME. This algorithm assists to identify children at greater risk of auditory disadvantage. Cluster groups with more elevated pure tone thresholds may be targeted for priority in clinical surveillance and medical/surgical intervention.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1080%2f09638288.2017.1290698,SFX,28637148 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28637148]

Zebrafish hair cells, contained within neuromasts along the lateral line, can be damaged with exposure to ototoxins, and therefore, pre-exposure to potentially otoprotective compounds can be a means of identifying promising new drug candidates. Unfortunately, anatomical assays of hair cell damage are typically low-throughput and labor intensive, requiring trained experts to manually score hair cell damage in fluorescence or confocal images. To enhance throughput and consistency, our group has developed an automated damage-scoring algorithm based on machine-learning techniques that produce accurate damage scores, eliminate potential operator bias, provide more fidelity in determining damage scores that are between two levels, and deliver consistent results in a fraction of the time required for manual analysis. The system has been validated against trained experts using linear regression, hypothesis testing, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Furthermore, performance has been quantified by measuring mean absolute error for each image and the time taken to automatically compute damage scores. Coupling automated analysis of zebrafish hair cell damage to behavioral assays for ototoxicity produces a novel drug discovery platform for rapid translation of candidate drugs into preclinical mammalian models of hearing loss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1089%2fzeb.2017.1451,SFX,29381431 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29381431]

Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. Search Method(s): We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016. Selection Criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure. Data Collection and Analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance. Main Result(s): We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). Effects on noise exposure Engineering interventions following legislation One ITS study found that new legislation in the mining industry reduced the median personal noise exposure dose in underground coal mining by 27.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 percentage points) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation. This roughly translates to a 4.5 dB(A) decrease in noise level. The intervention was associated with a favourable but statistically non-significant downward trend in time of the noise dose of -2.1 percentage points per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7, 4 year follow-up, very low-quality evidence). Engineering intervention case studies We found 12 studies that described 107 uncontrolled case studies of immediate reductions in noise levels of machinery ranging from 11.1 to 19.7 dB(A) as a result of purchasing new equipment, segregating noise sources or installing panels or curtains around sources. However, the studies lacked long-term follow-up and dose measurements of workers, and we did not use these studies for our conclusions. Hearing protection devices In general hearing protection devices reduced noise exposure on average by about 20 dB(A) in one RCT and three CBAs (57 participants, low-quality evidence). Two RCTs showed that, with instructions for insertion, the attenuation of noise by earplugs was 8.59 dB better (95% CI 6.92 dB to 10.25 dB) compared to no instruction (2 RCTs, 140 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Administrative controls: information and noise exposure feedback On-site training sessions did not have an effect on personal noise-exposure levels compared to information only in one cluster-RCT after four months' follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.14 dB; 95% CI -2.66 to 2.38). Another arm of the same study found that personal noise exposure information had no effect on noise levels (MD 0.30 dB(A), 95% CI -2.31 to 2.91) compared to no such information (176 participants, low-quality evidence). Effects on hearing loss Hearing protection devices In two studies the authors compared the effect of different devices on temporary threshold shifts at short-term follow-up but reported insufficient data for analysis. In two CBA studies the authors found no difference in hearing loss from noise exposure above 89 dB(A) between muffs and earplugs at long-term follow-up (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03 ), very low-quality evidence). Authors of another CBA study found that wearing hearing protection more often resulted in less hearing loss at very long-term follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Combination of interventions: hearing loss prevention programmes One cluster-RCT found no difference in hearing loss at three- or 16-year follow-up between an intensive HLPP for agricultural students and audiometry only. One CBA study found no reduction of the rate of hearing loss (MD -0.82 dB per year (95% CI -1.86 to 0.22) for a HLPP that provided regular personal noise exposure information compared to a programme without this information. There was very-low-quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of hearing protection devices as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69). Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect. In three long-term CBA studies, workers in a HLPP had a statistically non-significant 1.8 dB (95% CI -0.6 to 4.2) greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than non-exposed workers and the confidence interval includes the 4.2 dB which is the level of hearing loss resulting from 5 years of exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, of three other CBA studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis, two showed an increased risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers and one CBA did not. Authors' conclusions: There is very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up is still needed. There is very low-quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. Rather, it means that further research is very likely to have an important impact.Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The study investigated the interaction effects of noise, tone type, age, and hearing status on monaural tone perception, and assessed the application of a hierarchical clustering algorithm for profiling hearing impairment in children with OME. Method(s): Forty-one children with normal hearing and normal middle ear status and 84 children with OME with or without hearing loss participated in this study. The children with OME were further divided into two subgroups based on their severity and pattern of hearing loss using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Monaural tone recognition was measured using a picture-identification test format incorporating six sets of monosyllabic words conveying four lexical tones under speech spectrum noise, with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions ranging from -9 to -21 dB. Result(s): Linear correlation indicated tone recognition thresholds of children with OME were significantly correlated with age and pure tone hearing thresholds at every frequency tested. Children with hearing thresholds less affected by OME performed similarly to their peers with normal hearing. Tone recognition thresholds of children with auditory status more affected by OME were significantly inferior to those of children with normal hearing or with minor hearing loss. Younger children demonstrated poorer tone recognition performance than older children with OME. A mixed design repeated-measure ANCOVA showed significant main effects of listening condition, hearing status, and tone type on tone recognition. Contrast comparisons revealed that tone recognition scores were significantly better under -12 dB SNR than under -15 dB SNR conditions and tone recognition scores were significantly worse under -18 dB SNR than those obtained under -15 dB SNR conditions. Tone 1 was the easiest tone to identify and Tone 3 was the most difficult tone to identify for all participants, when considering -12, -15, and -18 dB SNR as within-subject variables. The interaction effect between hearing status and tone type indicated that children with greater levels of OME-related hearing loss had more impaired tone perception of Tone 1 and Tone 2 compared to their peers with lesser levels of OME-related hearing loss. However, tone perception of Tone 3 and Tone 4 remained similar among all three groups. Tone 2 and Tone 3 were the most perceptually difficult tones for children with or without OME-related hearing loss in all listening conditions. Conclusion(s): The hierarchical clustering algorithm demonstrated usefulness in risk stratification for tone perception deficiency in children with OME-related hearing loss. There was marked impairment in tone perception in noise for children with greater levels of OME-related hearing loss. Monaural lexical tone perception in younger children was more vulnerable to noise and OME-related hearing loss than that in older children.Copyright © 2017 Cai et al.

Two broad classes of emissions, linear reflection and nonlinear distortion, arise via distinct cochlear processes and hence, appear to provide independent information about cochlear health and hearing. Considered in combination, these two OAE types may characterize sensory hearing loss most effectively. In this study, the level-dependent growth of stimulus-frequency OAEs (a reflection-type emission) and distortion-product OAEs (a distortion-type emission) were measured in ten normal-hearing ears and eight ears with slight-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Metrics of OAE strength and compression were derived from OAE input/output functions and then considered in a combined fashion. Results indicate that SFOAEs and DPOAEs differ significantly in their strength and compression features. When SFOAE and DPOAE metrics are displayed together on a two-dimensional plot, relatively well-defined data clusters describe their normative relationship. In hearing-impaired ears, this relationship is disrupted but not in a uniform way across ears; ears with similar audiograms showed differently altered joint-OAE profiles. Hearing loss sometimes affected only one OAE or one more than the other. Results suggest a joint-OAE profile is promising and warrants study in a large group of subjects with sensory hearing loss of varied etiologies.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1121%2f1.4996859,SFX,28863614 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28863614]

In contrast, individuals with normal hearing perform this task quite well. This listening situation represents a very different problem for both the human and machine listener, when compared to perceiving speech in other types of background noise. A machine learning algorithm is introduced here to address this listening situation. A deep neural network was trained to estimate the ideal ratio mask for a male target talker in the presence of a female competing talker. The monaural algorithm was found to produce sentence-intelligibility increases for hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This benefit was largest for the HI listeners and averaged 59%-points at the least-favorable SNR, with a maximum of 87%-points. The mean intelligibility achieved by the HI listeners using the algorithm was equivalent to that of young NH listeners without processing, under conditions of identical interference. Possible reasons for the limited ability of HI listeners to perceptually segregate concurrent voices are reviewed as are possible implementation considerations for algorithms like the current one.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1121%2f1.4984271,SFX,28618817 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28618817]

Although telomere attrition has been shown as a determinant in the pathobiology of various age-related diseases, it remains unknown whether telomere length is associated with ARHI. We hypothesized that decreased leukocyte telomere length (LTL) increased the risk of ARHI. Thus, we measured LTL of 666 ARHI and 43 controls by an established quantitative PCR technique. Four audiogram shape subtypes of ARHI, including ""flat shape (FL)"", ""2-4kHz abrupt loss (AL) shape"", ""8kHz dip (8D) shape"" and ""sloping shape (SL)"" could be identified among the cases using K-means cluster analysis. Longer LTL was associated with the reduced incidence of ARHI (adjusted OR=0.550, 95% CI: 0.420-0.721, P<0.0001 for all the ARHI; 0.498, 0.318-0.780, P=0.0023 for FL subgroup; 0.428, 0.292-0.628, P<0.0001 for AL subgroup; 0.552, 0.399-0.764, P=0.0003 for mSL subgroup).

There was a descending trend of LTL as the degree of pure tone threshold average (PTA) aggravated.

Accurate predictions of the consonant recognition scores were obtained across a large range of signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, the model yielded convincing predictions of the consonant confusion scores, such that the predicted errors were clustered in perceptually plausible confusion groups. The large predictive power of the proposed model suggests that adaptive processes in the auditory preprocessing in combination with a cross-correlation based template-matching back end can account for some of the processes underlying consonant perception in normal-hearing listeners.

Design Cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Setting Health centres in Thyolo district, Malawi. Participants Ten health centres participated, 5 intervention (29 CHWs) and 5 control (28 CHWs). Intervention Intervention CHWs received 3 days of training in primary ear and hearing care, while among control CHWs, training was delayed for 6 months. Both groups were given a pretest that assessed knowledge about ear and hearing care, only the intervention group was given the posttest on the third day of training. The intervention group was given 1 month to identify patients with ear and hearing disorders in their communities, and these people were screened for hearing disorders by ear, nose and throat clinical specialists. Outcome measures Primary outcome measure was improvement in knowledge of ear and hearing care among CHWs after the training. Secondary outcome measures were number of patients with ear or hearing disorders identified by CHWs and number recorded at health centres during routine activities, and the perceived feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results The average overall correct answers increased from 55% to 68% (95% CI 65 to 71) in the intervention group (p<0.001). A total of 1739 patients with potential ear and hearing disorders were identified by CHWs and 860 patients attended the screening camps, of whom 400 had hearing loss (73 patients determined through bilateral fail on otoacoustic emissions, 327 patients through audiometry). Where cause could be determined, the most common cause of ear and hearing disorders was chronic suppurative otitis media followed by impacted wax. The intervention was perceived as feasible and acceptable to implement. Conclusions Training was effective in improving the knowledge of CHW in ear and hearing care in Malawi and allowing them to identify patients with ear and hearing disorders.

Recent developments in stem cell technology provide new opportunities for the treatment of deafness. miRNAs are essential factors of an extensively conserved posttranscriptional process controlling gene expression at mRNA level. Various biological processes such as growth and differentiation are regulated by miRNAs. In this review paper we have discussed about the application of miR-183 family and mesenchymal stem cells as a possibility for restoring hearing loss. In this regards, the web of Science and PubMed databases were searched using the Endnote software for the publications about the application of miR-183 family and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to study hearing loss published from 2000 to 2016. The miR-183 family (miR-183, miR-96, and miR-182) is expressed abundantly in sensory cells in inner ear. miR-183 family is significant for the development and persistence of auditory neurons and hair cell. These four genes, i.e. Sox2, Notch1, Jag1, and Hes1, are potentially the targets of miR-183 family. In studies on animal models such as mouse and zebrafish, the time of Atoh1 expression in the hair cells was found to be the E12/5-E14/5 day, and miR-183 family was reported to begin to express on the E14/5 day. Use of human MSCs in differentiating into hair cells has been investigated, demonstrating that MSCs have neuroregenerative capacity. Cell therapy-targeting regeneration of the auditory neurons and hair cell may therefore be a powerful strategy to cure hearing loss that cannot be reversed by current therapies. A combination of the MSCs, specific growth factors and miR-183 cluster (96-182-183) can increase the potential to differentiate into the auditory neurons and hair cell.Copyright © 2017 Medknow Publications.

A secondary objective was to explore factors associated with CSOM in this population. Methods We performed a community-based cross-sectional study of children aged 4-6 years in Chikhwawa District, Southern Malawi, utilising a village-level cluster design. Participants underwent a structured clinical assessment, including video-otoscopy and screening audiometry. Diagnoses were made remotely by two otolaryngologists who independently reviewed clinical data and images collected in the field. Hearing impairment was classified as failure to hear a pure tone of 25dB or greater at 1, 2 or 4kHz. Results We recruited 281 children across 10 clusters. The prevalence estimates of CSOM, unilateral hearing impairment and bilateral hearing impairment were 5.4% (95%CI 2.2-8.6), 24.5% (95%CI 16.3-30.0), and 12.5% (95%CI 6.2-16.9) respectively. Middle ear disease was seen in 46.9% of children with hearing impairment. A trend towards increased risk of CSOM was observed with sleeping in a house with >2 other children. Interpretation We found a high burden of middle ear disease and preventable hearing impairment in our sample of school-entry age children in rural Malawi. There are important public health implications of these findings as CSOM and hearing impairment can affect educational outcomes, and may impact subsequent development. The identification and management of middle ear disease and hearing impairment represent major unmet needs in this population.Copyright © 2017 Hunt et al.

The complete identification of novel genes related to MD would help elucidate its underlying pathological mechanisms and improve its diagnosis and treatment. In this study, a network-based method was developed to identify novel MD-related genes based on known MD-related genes. A human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the PPI information reported in the STRING database. A classic ranking algorithm, the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, was employed to search for novel genes using known genes as seed nodes. To make the identified genes more reliable, a series of screening tests, including a permutation test, an interaction test and an enrichment test, were designed to select essential genes from those obtained by the RWR algorithm. As a result, several inferred genes, such as CD4, NOTCH2 and IL6, were discovered. Finally, a detailed biological analysis was performed on fifteen of the important inferred genes, which indicated their strong associations with MD.Copyright © 2017 Li et al.

The metabolic phenotype is thought to result from deterioration of the cochlear lateral wall and reduced endocochlear potential that decreases cochlear amplification and produces a mild, flat hearing loss at lower frequencies coupled with a gradually sloping hearing loss at higher frequencies. The sensory phenotype, resulting from environmental exposures such as excessive noise or ototoxic drugs, involves damage to sensory and non-sensory cells and loss of the cochlear amplifier, which produces a 50-70 dB threshold shift at higher frequencies. The mixed metabolic + sensory phenotype exhibits a mix of lower frequency, sloping hearing loss similar to the metabolic phenotype, and steep, higher frequency hearing loss similar to the sensory phenotype. The current study examined audiograms collected longitudinally from 343 adults 50-93 years old (n = 686 ears) to test the hypothesis that metabolic phenotypes increase with increasing age, in contrast with the sensory phenotype. A Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) was used to classify audiograms from each of these ears as (1) Older-Normal, (2) Metabolic, (3) Sensory, or (4) Metabolic + Sensory phenotypes. Although hearing loss increased systematically with increasing age, audiometric phenotypes remained stable for the majority of ears (61.5 %) over an average of 5.5 years. Most of the participants with stable phenotypes demonstrated matching phenotypes for the left and right ears. Audiograms were collected over an average period of 8.2 years for ears with changing audiometric phenotypes, and the majority of those ears transitioned to a Metabolic or Metabolic + Sensory phenotype. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the likelihood of metabolic presbyacusis increases with increasing age in middle to older adulthood.Copyright © 2016, Association for Research in Otolaryngology.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1007%2fs10162-016-0596-2,SFX,27830350 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27830350]

(E-mail: info@frontiersin.org),"Acoustic trauma is the most common cause of hearing loss and tinnitus in humans. However, the impact of acoustic trauma on system biology is not fully understood. It has been increasingly recognized that tinnitus caused by acoustic trauma is unlikely to be generated by a single pathological source, but rather a complex network of changes involving not only the auditory system but also systems related to memory, emotion and stress. One obvious and significant gap in tinnitus research is a lack of biomarkers that reflect the consequences of this interactive ""tinnitus-causing"" network. In this study, we made the first attempt to analyse brain metabolic changes in rats following acoustic trauma using metabolomics, as a pilot study prior to directly linking metabolic changes to tinnitus. Metabolites in 12 different brain regions collected from either sham or acoustic trauma animals were profiled using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomics platform. After deconvolution of mass spectra and identification of the molecules, the metabolomic data were processed using multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component analysis showed that metabolic patterns varied among different brain regions; however, brain regions with similar functions had a similar metabolite composition. Acoustic trauma did not change the metabolite clusters in these regions. When analyzed within each brain region using the orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis sub-model, 17 molecules showed distinct separation between control and acoustic trauma groups in the auditory cortex, inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, vestibular nucleus complex (VNC), and cerebellum. Further metabolic pathway impact analysis and the enrichment overview with network analysis suggested the primary involvement of amino acid metabolism, including the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathways, the arginine and proline metabolic pathways and the purine metabolic pathway. Our results provide the first metabolomics evidence that acoustic trauma can induce changes in multiple metabolic pathways. This pilot study also suggests that the metabolomic approach has the potential to identify acoustic trauma-specific metabolic shifts in future studies where metabolic changes are correlated with the animal's tinnitus status.Copyright © 2017 He, Zhu, Aa, Smith, De Ridder, Wang and Zheng.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.3389%2ffnins.2017.00148,SFX,

Aim(s): We conducted a population-based study to investigate the prevalence of self-reported hearing problem and its relationship with audiometric hearing thresholds in older adults in Selangor, Malaysia. We also investigated demographic factors that were associated with the self-reported hearing loss. Material(s) and Method(s): The participants were recruited from Selangor using a multi-stage clustered sampling involving 324 participants aged between 60 to 88-year-old (68.3+/-5.9 years). All participants underwent a face-to-face interview and pure tone audiometry. Self-reported hearing loss was obtained using three questions. Result(s): The prevalence of self-reported hearing problems was 53.4%. This prevalence did not differ significantly among age group, gender, race and education level (p>0.05). Univariate and logistic regression analyses found that tinnitus and Pure Tone Average (PTA) of at least moderate hearing loss at 0.5 kHz to 4 kHz contributed significantly to the likelihood of self-reported hearing problem. Participants with tinnitus and participants with PTA at least moderate hearing loss at 0.5 kHz to 4 kHz were twice as likely to report hearing problem than their counterparts. The questions yielded poor sensitivity in identifying at least mild loss and moderate sensitivity for at least moderate hearing loss. Conclusion(s): The present study highlights the need for a more effective self-report inventory or audiometry instrument that is less sensitive to background noise to better estimate hearing loss prevalence among adults in Malaysia.Copyright © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

This balance is regulated by neuromodulators, such as endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids). Cannabinoid drugs are potent anti-nociceptive agents in models of chronic neuropathic pain, a condition that shares substantial parallels with tinnitus, i.e. phantom sensory percept in the absence of sensory input, initiated peripherally through deafferentation and subsequently involving central mechanisms. We therefore sought to determine whether the highly-selective CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) could abolish putative neural mechanisms of tinnitus. Guinea pigs (GPs) were first implanted with electrocorticography (ECoG) multi-electrode assemblies. Following baseline data collection, GPs were given intraperitoneal injections of either (1) sodium salicylate in order to induce tinnitus (350 mg kg-1; n = 8), (2) salicylate co-administered with ACEA (1 mg kg-1; n = 5), or (3) ACEA alone (1 mg kg-1; n = 4). Resting-state and auditory-evoked neural activity recorded in awake GPs was compared between groups. Hearing status was assessed using the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Cluster-based permutation analysis indicated that salicylate altered resting-state activity, specifically by reducing alpha band activity (6-10 Hz) in cortical oscillations. Auditory-evoked responses were also enhanced (between 79-145%), whilst wave I ABR amplitudes were significantly decreased at 20 kHz (p < 0.01 for both left and right ears). Co-administration of ACEA still resulted in slight reductions in ABR amplitudes, but these were no longer significant (p = 0.07 left ear; p = 0.2 right ear). Decreases in oscillatory activity at 6-10 Hz were no longer evident, although enhanced cortical potentials were still present (between 61-159%). Administration of ACEA alone did not significantly affect auditory system function. These data indicate that manipulating endocannabinoid signalling in a tinnitus model can affect some of the underlying neural mechanisms. We are currently collecting data to determine whether ACEA can also abolish behavioural evidence of tinnitus.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1177%2f2398212817705279,SFX,

There is considerable variation in disease burden between countries, and no data on the epidemiology of CSOM in Malawi. Facilities to diagnose and manage CSOM and other middle ear disease are often limited in rural, low-resource healthcare systems. Aim To estimate the prevalence of World Health Organizationdefined CSOM and educationally significant hearing impairment in a representative sample of school-entry age children in rural Malawi, and to evaluate the diagnostic quality of protocolised tele-otoscopy assessment in this setting. Methods We performed a community-based cross-sectional survey of children aged 4-6 years in Chikhwawa District, Southern Malawi, utilising a village-level cluster design. Participants underwent a structured clinical assessment, including video-otoscopy and screening audiometry performed by a Malawian Clinical Officer. Middle-ear diagnoses were made remotely by two otolaryngologists who reviewed clinical data and images collected in the field. Hearing impairment was classified as failure to hear a pure tone of 25 dB at 1, 2 or 4kH. Results We recruited 281 children across 10 village-clusters. The prevalence estimates of CSOM, unilateral hearing impairment and bilateral hearing impairment were 5.4% (95% CI 2.2-8.6), 24.5% (95% CI 16.3-30.0), and 12.5% (95% CI 6.2-16.9) respectively. Treatable middle ear disease was seen in 46.9% of children with hearing impairment. Tele-otoscopy produced diagnostic middle ear data in 87.7% (493/562) of ears. Conclusion We found a high burden of treatable ear disease and hearing impairment in our study. Identification and management of middle ear disease and hearing impairment represent major unmet needs in this population. Protocolised tele-otoscopy assessment may facilitate extension of otolaryngology services to rural communities, and is worthy of further evaluation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1111%2f%2528ISSN%25291365-3156,SFX,

We previously reported that global gene ablation (KO) of NCB5OR in mice resulted in early-onset diabetes in association with elevated mitochondrial proliferation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cells. Mild anemia and iron deficiency have also been observed in prediabetic KO mice. To further investigate the effects of NCB5OR deficiency on iron homeostasis, we subjected these mice to dietary iron modulation. While an iron deficient diet (< 5 ppm) worsens all the phenotypes, an iron sufficient diet (300 ppm) alleviates only anemia, not the others. 59Fe pulse-feeding experiments revealed increased iron flux among major tissues, especially in the brain, consistent with increased transcript and protein expression of genes involved in iron uptake and export, such as transferrin receptor 1 and ferroportin 1, in parallel to decreased ferritin protein levels. Prediabetic KO mice also exhibit hyperactivity in association with elevated dopamine levels in the cortex, as well as hearing loss through analysis of auditory brainstem responses (ABE) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). The latter phenotype was associated with increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response and iron uptake in the cochlea. The roles of NCB5OR deficiency in diabetes and neurologic function were concluded to be cell autonomous by studies of NCB5OR conditional knockout mice of the pancreatic beta-cells (PKO) and the cerebellum / midbrain (CKO), respectively. Early-onset diabetes was observed in PKO mice, and the islets in the prediabetic animals displayed reduced activity of mitochondrial Complex I that is rich in iron sulfur clusters. CKO mice are diabetes free but hypersensitive to harmaline-induced tremor and diet-induced neurologic changes, including reduced locomotor activity, altered complex motor task execution, and gait abnormalities. Assessment of molecular markers in the cerebellum of CKO mice revealed changes in pathways associated with cellular and mitochondrial iron homeostasis. These observations show that iron dyshomeostasis caused by NCB5OR deficiency leads to major cellular defects and conditions that are commonly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Studies are ongoing to characterize how NCB5OR may be involved in the cellular processing of iron.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1002%2fajh.24812,SFX,

Changes in Nav channel expression at the heminode, the final node before the nerve terminal, can alter AP invasion into the presynaptic terminal. We studied the activity-dependent formation of Nav channel clusters before and after hearing onset at postnatal day 12 in the rat and mouse auditory brain stem. In rats, the Nav channel cluster at the heminode formed progressively during the second postnatal week, around hearing onset, whereas the Nav channel cluster at the nodes was present before hearing onset. Initiation of heminodal Nav channel clustering was correlated with the expression of scaffolding protein ankyrinG and paranodal protein Caspr. However, in whirler mice with congenital deafness, heminodal Nav channels did not form clusters and maintained broad expression, but Nav channel clustering was normal at the nodes. In addition, a clear difference in the distance from the heminodal Nav channel to the calyx across the mediolateral axis of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) developed after hearing onset. In the medial MNTB, where neurons respond best to high-frequency sounds, the heminodal Nav channel cluster was located closer to the terminal than in the lateral MNTB, where neurons respond best to low-frequency sounds. Thus sound-mediated neuronal activities are potentially associated with the refinement of the heminode adjacent to the presynaptic terminal in the auditory brain stem. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Clustering of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels and their distribution along the axon, specifically at the unmyelinated axon segment next to the nerve terminal, are essential for tuning propagated action potentials. Nav channel clusters near the nerve terminal and their location as a function of neuronal position along the mediolateral axis are controlled by auditory inputs after hearing onset.

The recorded local field potentials were subsequently evaluated using current source density (CSD) analysis to identify sources and sinks. Current sinks are thought to be an indicator of net synaptic current in the small volume of cortex surrounding the recording site. Thus, CSD analysis combined with multielectrode arrays enabled us to compare mean synaptic activity in response to small current stimuli on a layer-by-layer basis. We also used senescence-accelerated mice (SAM), some strains of which show earlier onset of age-related hearing loss, to examine the characteristic spatiotemporal CSD profiles stimulated by electrodes in specific cortical layers. Thus, the CSD patterns were classified into several clusters based on stimulation sites in the cortical layers. We also found some differences in CSD patterns between the two SAM strains in terms of aging according to principle component analysis with dimension reduction. For simultaneous two-site stimulation, we modeled the obtained CSD profiles as a linear superposition of the CSD profiles to individual single-site stimulation. The model analysis indicated the nonlinearity of spatiotemporal integration over stimulus-driven activity in a layer-specific manner.

Method(s): We selected 51 clusters of 80 people (all ages) through probability proportionate to size sampling. Initial hearing screening was undertaken through an otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. Participants aged 4+ years who failed this test in both ears or for whom an OAE reading could not be taken underwent a manual pure-tone audiometry (PTA) screening. Cases of hearing impairment were defined as those with pure-tone average >=41 dBHL in adults and >=35 dBHL in children in the better ear, or children under age 4 who failed the OAE test in both ears. Each case with hearing loss was examined by an ear, nose and throat nurse who indicated the main likely cause. Result(s): We examined 3567 (86.9%) of 4104 eligible people. The overall prevalence of hearing impairment was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-4.6). The prevalence was low in people aged 0-17 (1.1%, 0.7-1.8%) and 18-49 (1.1%, 0.5-2.6%) and then rose sharply in people aged 50+ (14.8%, 11.7-19.1%). Among cases, the majority were classified as moderate (76%), followed by severe (15%) and profound (9%). More than one-third of cases of hearing impairment were classified as unknown (37%) or conductive (37%) causes, while sensorineural causes were less common (26%). Conclusion(s): Prevalence of hearing impairment in North-West Cameroon is in line with the WHO estimate for sub-Saharan Africa.

Even if a complex interaction of many factors is involved in the etiology of tinnitus, hearing loss (HL) has been identified as the most relevant etiologic factor. Here, we used a data-driven approach to identify patterns of hearing function in a large sample of tinnitus patients presenting in a tinnitus clinic. Method(s): Data from 2,838 patients presenting at the Tinnitus Center of the University Regensburg between 2007 and 2014 have been analyzed. Standard audiometric data were frequency-wise categorized in four categories [a: normal hearing (0-20 dB HL); b: moderate HL (25-50 dB HL; representing outer hair cell loss); c: severe HL (> 50 dB HL; representing outer and inner hair cell loss); d: no data available] and entered in a latent class analysis, a statistical method to find subtypes of cases in multivariate categorical data. To validate the clinical relevance of the identified latent classes, they were compared with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics of their members. Result(s): The classification algorithm identified eight distinct latent classes with an excellent separation. Patient classes differed with respect to demographic (e.g., age, gender) and clinical characteristics (e.g., tinnitus location, tinnitus severity, gradual, or abrupt onset, etc.). Discussion(s): Our results demonstrate that data-driven categorization of hearing function seems to be a promising approach for profiling tinnitus patients, as it revealed distinct subtypes that reflect prototypic forms of HL and that differ in several relevant clinical characteristics.Copyright © 2017 Langguth, Landgrebe, Schlee, Schecklmann, Vielsmeier, Steffens, Staudinger, Frick and Frick.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.3389%2ffneur.2017.00046,SFX,

Study design: The study was conducted in three different phases. The Kannada low frequency wordlists were developed in Phase I. The procedure involved collecting bi-syllabic familiar words, recording them, selecting the words dominant in low frequency energy by acoustical (Fast Fourier) transform and statistical means (k-means clustering) then generating equivalent wordlists using psychometric function. In Phase II, all the wordlists developed were standardized through estimation of speech identification scores in 100 individuals with normal hearing and through re-verification of equivalence of wordlists' difficulty level by obtaining psychometric function. Finally, during Phase III, lists developed were evaluated for usefulness by administering them along with conventional phonemically-balanced Kannada wordlist on 10 individuals with cochlear hearing loss having rising audiometric configurations (i.e. more loss at lower frequencies). Result(s): Phase I resulted in development of seven psychometrically equivalent wordlists. Speech identification scores on 100 individuals with normal hearing showed mean scores greater than 95% for all the lists at 40 dB SL. No statistical difference was noted across wordlists. Further, individuals with rising cochlear hearing loss (RCHL) performed significantly poorer when compared to normal hearing counterparts across wordlists except low frequency wordlist 4 and phonemically balanced wordlist. Conclusion(s): The study utilized a unique procedure for the development of wordlists which can serve as guidelines for further research. The study has resulted in standardization (along with generation of normative data) and successful validation of the lists (except list 4) developed on a clinical population, i.e. individuals with RCHL.

This is attributed to recreational noise being the most common cause of this problem. In young children, hearing problems can delay language development and reduce academic achievements. South Africa, in particular, has limited information and protective measures regarding the conservation of hearing in school-aged children.
OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study was to determine the perception of primary school teachers regarding NIHL. The study also aimed to determine if any hearing conservation programmes are being implemented in schools and the need for training of primary school teachers regarding NIHL.
METHOD: A survey was conducted. In order to cover the population of interest, the sampled schools in Pretoria were clustered into urban, semi-urban and rural areas.
RESULTS: The majority of the teachers included in this study are aware of NIHL and its effects. They, however, lack the necessary resources and knowledge to effectively use this information. Most (67.5%) of the teachers indicated that they have never been exposed to children with NIHL in a school setting. It was also found that the majority (84%) of the schools included in the study do not implement hearing screening and conservation programmes.
CONCLUSION: Although the sample size was limited, the results correlate with other research in this field indicating a need for planning and implementation of hearing conservation programmes in schools, including training of teachers in order for these programmes to be effective.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.4102%2fsajcd.v64i1.185,SFX,28397520 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28397520]

Method: Two hundred ninety-seven adults (182 women, 115 men) from rural areas, urban clusters, and an urban city of west Central Alabama completed a hearing assessment, a physical health questionnaire, a hearing handicap measure, and a visual memory test.
Results: A greater number of adults with hearing loss lived in rural areas and urban clusters than in an urban area. In addition, poorer physical health was significantly associated with hearing loss. A greater number of individuals with poor physical health who lived in rural towns and urban clusters had hearing loss compared with the adults with other physical health issues who lived in an urban city. Poorer hearing sensitivity resulted in poorer outcomes on the Emotional and Social subscales of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults. And last, visual memory, a working-memory task, was not associated with hearing loss but was associated with educational level.
Conclusions: The outcomes suggest that hearing loss is associated with poor physical and emotional health but not with visual-memory skills. A greater number of adults living in rural areas experienced hearing loss compared with adults living in an urban city, and consequently, further research will be necessary to confirm this relationship and to explore the reasons behind it.

The current version utilizes a mixture of deterministic and probabilistic logic which is able to improve over time through a learning effect. This study aimed at assessing whether this learning capacity yields measurable improvements in speech understanding.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 25 consecutive CI recipients with a median CI use experience of 10 years who came for their annual CI follow-up fitting session. All subjects were assessed by means of speech audiometry with open set monosyllables at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL in quiet with their home MAP. Other psychoacoustic tests were executed depending on the audiologist's clinical judgment. The home MAP and the corresponding test results were entered into FOX. If FOX suggested to make MAP changes, they were implemented and another speech audiometry was performed with the new MAP.
RESULTS: FOX suggested MAP changes in 21 subjects (84%). The within-subject comparison showed a significant median improvement of 10, 3, 1, and 7% at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL, respectively. All but two subjects showed an instantaneous improvement in their mean speech audiometric score.
DISCUSSION: Persons with long-term CI use, who received a FOX-assisted CI fitting at least 6 months ago, display improved speech understanding after MAP modifications, as recommended by the current version of FOX. This can be explained only by intrinsic improvements in FOX's algorithms, as they have resulted from learning. This learning is an inherent feature of artificial intelligence and it may yield measurable benefit in speech understanding even in long-term CI recipients.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&DO=10.1080%2f14670100.2017.1325093,SFX,28498083 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28498083]

We investigated exposure to spoken language, noise, music, and quiet, and analyzed variation between age groups, users, and countries.
Results: CI users spent a substantial part of their daily life in noisy environments. As a consequence, most speech was presented in background noise. We found significant differences between age groups for all auditory scenes. Yet even within the same age group and country, variability between individuals was substantial.
Conclusions: Regardless of their age, people with CIs face challenging acoustical environments in their daily life.

In Malaysia, National and Hearing Disorder Survey has reported that the prevalence of hearing disorder is about 17.14% with an estimated population of 28.8 million and 1.5% newborns have the onset of hearing impairment. A conventional hearing screening test's applicability is limited as it requires a feedback response from the subject under test. In this paper, a simple method based on auditory evoked potential (AEP) is proposed to classify the hearing level of a subject. AEP signals are unilaterally recorded with monaural acoustical stimulus from the normal hearing and abnormal hearing subjects and the correlation between the brain dynamics and the hearing threshold response has been observed. From the recorded AEP signals, independent power spectral features (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) are extracted. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) learning algorithm is applied to a dynamic feedback neural network and a neural network model was developed to associate features with the normal and abnormal hearing levels. The PSO neural network employed with the independent spectral gamma band features has a maximum classification accuracy of 83.45% and 85.77% for the left and right ears across 20 subjects. This study indicates that the gamma band has a higher power value for hearing loss participants while compared with the normal hearing participants.

This process involves both high level cognitive processes (categorization) and low-level perceptual encoding of the acoustic signal, both of which are affected by the use of a cochlear implant (CI) device. The goal of this study was twofold: I) compare the categorization strategies of CI users and normal hearing listeners (NHL) II) investigate if any characteristics of the raw acoustic signal could explain the results. 16 experienced CI users and 20 NHL were tested using a Free-Sorting Task of 16 common sounds divided into 3 predefined categories of environmental, musical and vocal sounds. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Hierarchical Clustering based on Principal Components (HCPC) show that CI users followed a similar categorization strategy to that of NHL and were able to discriminate between the three different types of sounds. However results for CI users were more varied and showed less inter-participant agreement. Acoustic analysis also highlighted the average pitch salience and average autocorrelation peak as being important for the perception and categorization of the sounds. The results therefore show that on a broad level of categorization CI users may not have as many difficulties as previously thought in discriminating certain kinds of sound; however the perception of individual sounds remains challenging.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2016.03.007,SFX,27050944 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27050944]

This hearing loss is usually unilateral and can be associated with tinnitus and vertigo. The pathogenesis of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss is still unknown, and the alterations in the functional connectivity are suspected to involve one possible pathogenesis. Despite scarce findings with respect to alterations in brain functional networks in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss, the alterations of the whole brain functional connectome and whether these alterations were already in existence in the acute period remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of brain functional connectome in two large samples of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss patients and to investigate the correlation between unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss characteristics and changes in the functional network properties. Pure tone audiometry was performed to assess hearing ability. Abnormal changes in the peripheral auditory system were examined using conventional magnetic resonance imaging. The graph theoretical network analysis method was used to detect brain connectome alterations in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Compared with the control groups, both groups of unilateral SSNHL patients exhibited a significantly increased clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency but a significantly decreased characteristic path length. In addition, the primary increased nodal strength (e.g., nodal betweenness, hubs) was observed in several regions primarily, including the limbic and paralimbic systems, and in the auditory network brain areas. These findings suggest that the alteration of network organization already exists in unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss patients within the acute period and that the functional connectome of unilateral SSNHL patients is characterized by a shift toward small-worldization. Additionally, we hope that these findings will help to elucidate unilateral SSNHL through a new research perspective and provide insight for the potential pathophysiology of unilateral SSNHL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2016.02.016,SFX,26969260 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26969260]

In general, lower ECAP values are expected to generate better results. Aim was an analysis of ECAPs in the course of time as a function of the patient's age and electrode design. Patients and methods Between 2008 and 2013, 168 patients of eight defined age groups were included into the investigation. NRTs were measured intraoperatively, after 6 and after 12 months. Results The intraoperative mean value of ECAP was 174.14 CL (current level) and decreased after 6 months to 156.38 CL. Highest ECAPs were achieved intraoperatively in the clusters ""younger than 18 months"" (181.04 CL) and ""older than 80 years"" (190.45 CL). CI 422 showed apparently higher ECAP thresholds (182.69) during surgery than CI 24 RE (171.47) and CI 512 (170.64). Conclusion ECAPs are a well-established method to get information about the CI's and nerve's function during and after surgery. After initial higher values NRTs decrease after 6 months and remain stable in the following controls. Very young and older patients tend to have higher thresholds than middle-aged groups. Perimodiolar electrodes are significantly attached to lower values because there is a closer nerve-electrode interaction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1016%2fj.anorl.2016.04.015,SFX,27262349 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27262349]

Design(s): This is a longitudinal case series of prospective data assessing neurocognitive function and speech perception in an elderly cohort pre- and post-implantation. Setting(s): University cochlear implant center. Participant(s): The patients were post-lingually deafened elderly female (mean, 73.6 years; SD, 5.82; range, 67-81 years) cochlear implant recipients (n=7). Measurements: A neurocognitive battery of 20 tests assessing intellectual function, learning, short- and long-term memory, verbal fluency, attention, mental flexibility, and processing speed was performed prior to and 2-4.1 years (mean, 3.7) after cochlear implant (CI). Speech perception testing using Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant words was performed prior to implantation and at regular intervals postoperatively. Individual and aggregate differences in cognitive function pre- and post-CI were estimated. Logistic regression with cluster adjustment was used to estimate the association (%improvement or %decline) between speech understanding and years from implantation at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-CI. Result(s): Improvements after CI were observed in 14 (70%) of all subtests administered. Declines occurred in five (25%) subtests. In 55 individual tests (43%), post-CI performance improved compared to a patient's own performance before implantation. Of these, nine (45%) showed moderate or pronounced improvement. Overall, improvements were largest in the verbal and memory domains. Logistic regression demonstrated a significant relationship between speech perception and cognitive function over time. Five neurocognitive tests were predictive of improved speech perception following implantation. Conclusion(s): Comprehensive neurocognitive testing of elderly women demonstrated areas of improvement in cognitive function and auditory perception following cochlear implantation. Multiple neurocognitive tests were strongly associated with current speech perception measures. While these data shed light on the complex relationship between hearing and cognition by showing that CI may slow the expected age-related cognitive decline, further research is needed to examine the impact of hearing rehabilitation on cognitive decline.Copyright © 2016 Cosetti et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.2147%2fCIA.S100255,SFX,27274210 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27274210]

Broad activation of auditory nerve fibres when using a CI results in poor frequency discrimination. The CI also provides users with poor amplitude perception due to elicitation of a narrow dynamic range. Provision of more discrete frequency perception and a greater control over amplitude may allow users to better distinguish speech in noise and to segregate sound sources. In this research, thin-film (TF) high density micro-electrode arrays and conventional platinum ring electrode arrays were used to stimulate the cochlea of rats administered sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) via ototoxic insult, with neural responses taken at 434 multiunit clusters in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CIC). Threshold, dynamic range and broadness of response were used to compare electrode arrays. A stronger current was required to elicit CIC threshold when using the TF array compared to the platinum ring electrode array. TF stimulation also elicited a narrower dynamic range than the PR counterpart. However, monopolar stimulation using the TF array produced more localised CIC responses than other stimulation strategies. These results suggest that individuals with SNHL could benefit from micro stimulation of the cochlea using a monopolar configuration which may provide discrete frequency perception when using TF electrode arrays.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2015.10.003,SFX,26471198 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26471198]

Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are the evoked potentials used to measure the brain activity that occur in response to the auditory stimulus to the ear and to record the response by placing electrodes on the surface of the scalp. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials reflect neuronal activity in the auditory nerve pathway from the cochlea to the auditory cortex and are used in the diagnosis of neurological diseases leading to hearing loss. In the proposed automated system, the features of BAEPs are extracted in time domain based on latency, and in frequency domain, using fast Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform. The features extracted from BAEPs are used as variables to build a feed-forward multilayer perceptron, an artificial neural network model for the classification of BAEPs. The stratified 10-fold cross-validation technique is used in training and testing the model to estimate the performance of the system. The combined time and frequency domain features along with physiological parameters as input to artificial neural network resulted in a very good average accuracy of 90.74% in classifying the normal and abnormal BAEP signals.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To address this issue, we compared the noise-induced changes in spontaneous and tone-evoked responses from multiunit clusters (MUC) in the LA and Str with those seen in auditory cortex (AC) in rats. High-frequency octave band noise (10-20. kHz) and narrow band noise (16-20. kHz) induced permanent threshold shifts at high-frequencies within and above the noise band but not at low frequencies. While the noise trauma significantly elevated spontaneous discharge rate (SR) in the AC, SRs in the LA and Str were only slightly increased across all frequencies. The high-frequency noise trauma affected tone-evoked firing rates in frequency and time-dependent manner and the changes appeared to be related to the severity of noise trauma. In the LA, tone-evoked firing rates were reduced at the high-frequencies (trauma area) whereas firing rates were enhanced at the low-frequencies or at the edge-frequency dependent on severity of hearing loss at the high frequencies. The firing rate temporal profile changed from a broad plateau to one sharp, delayed peak. In the AC, tone-evoked firing rates were depressed at high frequencies and enhanced at the low frequencies while the firing rate temporal profiles became substantially broader. In contrast, firing rates in the Str were generally decreased and firing rate temporal profiles become more phasic and less prolonged. The altered firing rate and pattern at low frequencies induced by high-frequency hearing loss could have perceptual consequences. The tone-evoked hyperactivity in low-frequency MUC could manifest as hyperacusis whereas the discharge pattern changes could affect temporal resolution and integration.Copyright © 2015 IBRO.

CMT4D is an autosomal recessive early-onset severe polyneuropathy, caused by mutations in NDRG1. Hearing loss is an invariant feature. The p.R148* founder mutation was demonstrated in Gypsy communities of different countries. The morpho-functional assessment of SF in CMT4D has never been performed. We described a 33-year-old Italian female with severe neuropathy and hearing loss, who received CMT4 diagnosis at age 5. Her non-affected Gypsy parents were apparently non-consanguineous. Three sibs out of 5 were also affected. She had delayedmotor development with gait difficulties due to muscle weakness. Neuropathy worsened with evidence of hand motor impairment, dysphonia and dysphagia, respiratory difficulties, proximal weakness, severe sensory loss, confining her to a wheel-chair by age 31. Neurologic examination (age 32) showed: mild foot deformities, facial weakness, severe hearing loss, high-pitch dysphonia, vocal cord paresis (in abduction with stridor), diaphragmatic insufficiency, dysphagia, tongue atrophy with fibrillations, severe weakness and wasting in all limbs; absent tendon jerks; severe panmodal distal sensory loss, with trunk ataxia. Distal CMAPs and SAPs were absent at NCS; musculocutaneous nerve examination showed definite conduction slowing. CMTNSv2 was 32/36. Brain and spine MRI were normal. Audiometry and BAEP confirmed sensory-neural hearing loss. Genetic study targeted to NDGR1 showed the usual p.R148* mutation. Although she did not complain of any relevant SF sensory and autonomic symptoms, she showed functional and morphological signs of SF involvement. Indeed, Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR) was absent, sweat production was reduced at dynamic sweat test (DST) (Provitera et al., 2010), and thermal thresholds were altered in a length-dependent pattern. Cardiovascular reflexes were normal. Skin biopsy from thigh and leg revealed lack of myelinated fibers and morphologic abnormalities such as epidermal nerve fiber varicosities and clusters, whereas the count was in the normal range. Autonomic innervation study disclosed widespread nerve fiber loss around artero-venous anastomoses, sweat glands and along arrector pili muscles. We provide for the first time the evidence of SF involvement in CMT4D, expanding the disease characteristics. Large fibers were affected to a much greater extent than small somatic and autonomic fibers. SF derangement did not correlate with disease severity, CMTNS or SAPs amplitude. This case confirms that SF abnormalitiesmay be present even in absence of symptoms, underlining the need to investigate this aspect in different types of CMT.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1111%2fjns.12166,SFX,

Method(s): We undertook an all age population-based survey of disability in two areas: North-West Cameroon (August/October 2013) and Telangana State, India (Feb/April 2014). Participants were selected for inclusion via two-stage cluster randomised sampling (probability proportionate to size cluster selection and compact segment sampling within clusters). Disability was defined as the presence of self-reported functional limitations across eight domains, or presence of moderate or greater clinical impairments. Clinical impairment screening comprised of visual acuity testing for vision impairment, pure tone audiometry for hearing impairment, musculoskeletal functioning assessment for musculoskeletal impairment, reported seizure history for epilepsy and reported symptoms of clinical depression (depression adults only). Information was collected using structured questionnaires, observations and examinations. Result(s): Self-reported disability prevalence was 5.9% (95% CI 4.7-7.4) and 7.5% (5.9-9.4) in Cameroon and India respectively. The prevalence of moderate or greater clinical impairments in the same populations were 8.4% (7.5-9.4) in Cameroon and 10.5% (9.4-11.7) in India. Overall disability prevalence (self-report and/or screened positive to a moderate or greater clinical impairment) was 10.5% in Cameroon and 12.2% in India, with limited overlap between the sub-populations identified using the two types of tools. 33% of participants in Cameroon identified to have a disability, and 45% in India, both reported functional limitations and screened positive to objectively-screened impairments, whilst the remainder were identified via one or other tool only. A large proportion of people with moderate or severe clinical impairments did not self-report functional difficulties despite reporting participation restrictions. Conclusion(s): Tools to assess reported functional limitation alone are insufficient to identify all persons with participation restrictions and moderate or severe clinical impairments. A self-reported functional limitation tool followed by clinical screening of all those who report any level of difficulty would identify 94% of people with disabilities in Cameroon and 95% in India, meeting the study criteria.Copyright © 2016 Mactaggart et al.

In this study, we examined changes in brain anatomy associated with tinnitus using anatomical scans from 128 participants with tinnitus and hearing loss, tinnitus with clinically normal hearing, and non-tinnitus controls with clinically normal hearing. The groups were matched for hearing loss, age and gender. We employed voxel- and surface-based morphometry (SBM) to investigate gray and white matter volume and thickness within regions-of-interest (ROI) that were based on the results of previous studies. The largest overall effects were found for age, gender, and hearing loss. With regard to tinnitus, analysis of ROI revealed numerous small increases and decreases in gray matter and thickness between tinnitus and non-tinnitus controls, in both cortical and subcortical structures. For whole brain analysis, the main tinnitus-related significant clusters were found outside sensory auditory structures. These include a decrease in cortical thickness for the tinnitus group compared to controls in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and a decrease in cortical volume with hearing loss in left Heschl's gyrus (HG). For masked analysis, we found a decrease in gray matter volume in the right Heschle's gyrus for the tinnitus group compared to the controls. We found no changes in the subcallosal region as reported in some previous studies.

Such generalization would enable hearing aid and cochlear implant users to improve speech intelligibility in unknown noisy environments. This challenge is addressed in the current study through large-scale training. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained on 10000 noises to estimate the ideal ratio mask, and then employed to separate sentences from completely new noises (cafeteria and babble) at several signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Although the DNN was trained at the fixed SNR of - 2dB, testing using hearing-impaired listeners demonstrated that speech intelligibility increased substantially following speech segregation using the novel noises and unmatched SNR conditions of 0dB and 5dB. Sentence intelligibility benefit was also observed for normal-hearing listeners in most noisy conditions. The results indicate that DNN-based supervised speech segregation with large-scale training is a very promising approach for generalization to new acoustic environments.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1121%2f1.4948445,SFX,27250154 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27250154]

DESIGN: The SHQ was translated in accordance with the principles of the Universalist Model of cross-cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcome instruments. The SSQ and SHQ were then presented in a counterbalanced order, in a self-report mode, in a population of 230 HI subjects (mean age = 54 years and pure-tone audiometry [PTA] on the better ear = 28 dB HL) and 100 NH subjects (mean age = 21 years). The SHQ feasibility, readability, and psychometric properties were systematically investigated using reliability indices, cluster, and factor analyses and multiregression analyses. SHQ characteristics were compared both to different literature data obtained with different language versions and to the SSQ scores obtained in the same population.
RESULTS: Internal validity was high and very good reproducibility of scores and intersubject variability were obtained across the 24 items between the English and French SHQ for NH subjects. Factor and cluster analyses concurred in identifying five correlated factors, corresponding to several SHQ subscales: (1) speech in noise (corresponding to SHQ subscales 7 and 8), (2) localization of voice sounds from behind, (3) speech in quiet (corresponding to SHQ subscale 1), (4) localization of everyday sounds, and (5) localization of voices and music (corresponding to parts of the SHQ localization subscale). Correlations between SSQ subscales and SHQ factors identified the greatest correlations between SHQ factors 2, 4, and 5 and SSQ spatial subscales, whereas SHQ factor 1 had the greatest correlation with SSQ_speech. SHQ and SSQ scores were similar, whether in NH subjects (8.5 versus 8.4) or in HI subjects (6.6 for both), sharing more than 80% of variance. The SHQ localization subscale gave similar scores as the SSQ spatial subscale, sharing more than 75% of variance. Construct validity identified better ear PTA and PTA asymmetry as the two main predictors of SHQ scores, to a degree similar to that seen for the SSQ. The SHQ was shorter, easier to read and less sensitive to the number of years of formal education than the SSQ, but this came at a cost of ecological validity, which was rated higher for the SSQ than for the SHQ.
CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of factor analysis outcomes among the English, Dutch, and French versions of the SHQ confirmed good conceptual equivalence across languages and robustness of the SHQ for use in international settings. In addition, SHQ and SSQ scores showed remarkable similarities, suggesting the possibility of extrapolating the results from one questionnaire to the other. Although the SHQ was originally designed in a population of cochlear implant patients, the present results show that its usefulness could easily be extended to noncochlear-implanted, HI subjects.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000269,SFX,26808287 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26808287]

The aim of this study was to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of postimplant speech perception and oral language performance in children with hearing loss who receive a cochlear implant. The authors hypothesized positive correlations between blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation in brain regions related to auditory language processing and attention and scores on the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool, Second Edition (CELF-P2) and the Early Speech Perception Test for Profoundly Hearing-Impaired Children (ESP), in children with congenital hearing loss.
DESIGN: Eleven children with congenital hearing loss were recruited for the present study based on referral for clinical MRI and other inclusion criteria. All participants were <24 months at fMRI scanning and <36 months at first implantation. A silent background fMRI acquisition method was performed to acquire fMRI during auditory stimulation. A voxel-based analysis technique was utilized to generate z maps showing significant contrast in brain activation between auditory stimulation conditions (spoken narratives and narrow band noise). CELF-P2 and ESP were administered 2 years after implantation. Because most participants reached a ceiling on ESP, a voxel-wise regression analysis was performed between preimplant fMRI activation and postimplant CELF-P2 scores alone. Age at implantation and preimplant hearing thresholds were controlled in this regression analysis.
RESULTS: Four brain regions were found to be significantly correlated with CELF-P2 scores. These clusters of positive correlation encompassed the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, areas in the prefrontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus. For the story versus silence contrast, CELF-P2 core language score demonstrated significant positive correlation with activation in the right angular gyrus (r = 0.95), left medial frontal gyrus (r = 0.94), and left cingulate gyrus (r = 0.96). For the narrow band noise versus silence contrast, the CELF-P2 core language score exhibited significant positive correlation with activation in the left angular gyrus (r = 0.89; for all clusters, corrected p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Four brain regions related to language function and attention were identified that correlated with CELF-P2. Children with better oral language performance postimplant displayed greater activation in these regions preimplant. The results suggest that despite auditory deprivation, these regions are more receptive to gains in oral language development performance of children with hearing loss who receive early intervention via cochlear implantation. The present study suggests that oral language outcome following cochlear implant may be predicted by preimplant fMRI with auditory stimulation using natural speech.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000259,SFX,26689275 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26689275]

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between CD4 cell counts, viral load and hearing threshold of HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) infected adults.
METHODS: This cohort audiometric study involved consecutive HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults as controls. Clinical data relating to hearing loss, HIV status, and highly -active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were obtained. Audiornetric evaluation was performed. The most recent CD4 cell counts and RNA viral load-of HIV-infected participants were obtained from clinic records.
RESULTS: There were 299(66.7%) HIV-infected adults and 149(33.3%) controls with mean age of 39.64+/- 12.45 years and 39.60+/-12.45 years respectively (p=0.98). In both groups, there were more participants with left hearing loss. Mild to profound hearing loss was found in 65.9% HIV- infected participants and 53.7% controls. Majority (86.3%) of the HIV-infected participants were on HAART. The mean CD4 cell count was 654.58+/-289.15 in 41 HIV-infected participants not on HAART and 523.95+/-300.17 in 258 participants on HAART (p=0.01). Majority,- 197 (62%) HIV- infected participants with hearing loss had CD4 cell count <=200 cells/mm3. Higher viral load significantly correlated with low CD4 cell counts (p<0.0 1; r=0. 18) and low CD4 cell count significantly correlated with high hearing threshold (p<O.01; r=0. 17).
CONCLUSION: There was a trend towards more hearing loss among the HIV-infected adults. The higher hearing threshold in those with low CD4 cell counts of <200 cells/mm3 suggests possible relationship between hearing status and severity of HIV disease.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&AN=618597765,SFX,28686827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28686827]

Hearing aids and cochlear implants often allow good speech understanding in quiet backgrounds. But hearing-impaired individuals are highly noise intolerant, and existing devices are not very effective at combating background noise. As a result, speech understanding in noise is often quite poor. In accord with the significance of the problem, considerable effort has been expended toward understanding and remedying this issue. Fortunately, our understanding of the underlying issues is reasonably good. In sharp contrast, effective solutions have remained elusive. One solution that seems promising involves a single-microphone machine-learning algorithm to extract speech from background noise. Data from our group indicate that the algorithm is capable of producing vast increases in speech understanding by hearing-impaired individuals. This paper will first provide an overview of the speech-in-noise problem and outline why hearing-impaired individuals are so noise intolerant.

In studies on the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, the patient's acute audiogram is usually compared with a previous audiogram, the audiogram of the non-affected ear, or a normal audiogram according to an ISO standard. Generally, many more patients are screened than actually fulfill the particular inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria often require a calculation of pure-tone averages, selection of the most affected frequencies, and calculation of hearing loss differences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A software tool was developed to simplify and accelerate this inclusion procedure for investigators to estimate the possible recruitment rate during the planning phase of a clinical trial and during the actual study. This tool is Microsoft Excel-based and easy to modify to meet the particular inclusion criteria of a specific clinical trial. The tool was retrospectively evaluated on 100 patients with acute hearing loss comparing the times for classifying automatically and manually. The study sample comprised 100 patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): The age- and sex-related normative audiogram was calculated automatically by the tool and the hearing impairment was graded. The estimated recruitment rate of our sample was quickly calculated. Information about meeting the inclusion criteria was provided instantaneously.

DESIGN: ANLs were measured before hearing-aid fitting. Post-fitting outcome was assessed using the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and a hearing-aid use questionnaire. Models that predicted outcomes (successful vs. unsuccessful) were built using logistic regression and several machine learning algorithms, and were evaluated using the cross-validation technique.
STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 132 adults with hearing impairment.
RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of the models ranged from 61% to 68% (IOI-HA) and from 55% to 61% (hearing-aid use questionnaire). The models performed more poorly in predicting 12-month than three-month outcomes. The ANL cutoff between successful and unsuccessful users was higher for experienced (~18 dB) than first-time hearing-aid users (~10 dB), indicating that most experienced users will be predicted as successful users regardless of their ANLs.

The survey was conducted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and the classifcation of hearing impairment matched the WHO's criteria for the grading of hearing impairment.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hearing impairment in the population of this study was 12.35% (95%CI: 11.06% - 13.64%) and prevalence of disabling hearing impairment was 4.57% (95% CI: 3.75% - 5.39%) amongst individuals >= 4 years old.

STUDY DESIGN: This study pools available assessment data (collected prospectively and entered into respective databases from 1990 to 2014) from three Australian centers.
PATIENTS: Children (n = 403) with congenital bilateral severe to profound hearing loss who received cochlear implants under 6 years of age (excluding those with acquired onset of profound hearing loss after 12 mo, those with progressive hearing loss and those with mild/moderate/severe additional cognitive delay/disability).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Speech perception; open-set words (scored for words and phonemes correct) and sentence understanding at school entry and late primary school time points. Language; PLS and PPVT standard score equivalents at school entry, CELF standard scores. Speech Production; DEAP percentage accuracy of vowels, consonants, phonemes-total and clusters, and percentage word-intelligibility at school entry.
RESULTS: Regression analysis indicated a significant effect for age-at-implant for all outcome measures. Cognitive skills also accounted for significant variance in all outcome measures except open-set phoneme scores. ANOVA with Tukey pairwise comparisons examined group differences for children implanted younger than 12 months (Group 1), between 13 and 18 months (Group 2), between 19 and 24 months (Group 3), between 25 and 42 months (Group 4), and between 43 and 72 months (Group 5).

EEG based hearing threshold level determination is most suitable for persons who lack verbal communication and behavioral response to sound stimulation. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) is a type of EEG signal emanated from the brain scalp by an acoustical stimulus. The goal of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge in estimating the hearing threshold levels based on AEP response. AEP response reflects the auditory ability level of an individual. An intelligent hearing perception level system enables to examine and determine the functional integrity of the auditory system.

Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 500 newborns with no treatment. Mutations of inner ear genes contribute to the largest portion of genetic deafness. The simplicity and robustness of CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing in human cells and model organisms such as zebrafish, mice and primates make it a promising technology in hearing research. With CRISPR/Cas9 technology, functions of inner ear genes can be studied efficiently by the disruption of normal gene alleles through non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism. For genetic hearing loss, CRISPR/Cas9 has potential to repair gene mutations by homology-directed-repair (HDR) or to disrupt dominant mutations by NHEJ, which could restore hearing. Our recent work has shown CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear invivo. Thus, application of CRISPR/Cas9 in hearing research will open up new avenues for understanding the pathology of genetic hearing loss and provide new routes in the development of treatment to restore hearing. In this review, we describe major methodologies currently used for genome editing. We will highlight applications of these technologies in studies of genetic disorders and discuss issues pertaining to applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in auditory systems implicated in genetic hearing loss.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2015.04.016,SFX,25987504 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25987504]

Symptoms and conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and symptom-clusters were identified using latent class analysis. We identified seven classes with distinct symptom compositions. One class had low probability of any condition and low health care utilization (HCU) (48 %). Other classes were characterized by high probabilities of mental health comorbidities (14 %); chronic pain and sleep disturbance (20 %); headaches and memory problems (6 %); and auditory problems (2.5 %). Another class had mental health comorbidities and chronic pain (7 %), and the last had high probabilities of most symptoms examined (3 %). These last two classes had the highest likelihood of TBI, PTSD, and depression and were identified as high healthcare utilizers.

The mean cylinder was 0.65 +/- 1.3 D and 0.43 +/- 0.62 D in deaf and normal subjects, respectively (P = 0.002). 12.2% of deaf subjects and 1.2% of normal subjects were amblyopic (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of strabismus was 3.1% in the case group and 2.6% in the control group (P = 0.645). Conclusion(s): In a comparison of children of the same ages, hearing-impaired children have significantly more eye problems; therefore, a possible relation between deafness and eye problems must exist. Paying attention to eye health assessment in hearing-impaired children may help prevent adding eye problems to hearing difficulties.Copyright © 2015 Iranian Society of Ophthalmology.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1016%2fj.joco.2015.10.001,SFX,

However, ototoxicity is a common problem and is monitored using peak and trough amikacin concentrations based on World Health Organization recommendations. Our objective was to identify clinical factors predictive of ototoxicity using an agnostic machine learning method. We used classification and regression tree (CART) analyses to identify clinical factors, including amikacin concentration thresholds that predicted audiometry-confirmed ototoxicity among 28 multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Botswana. Amikacin concentrations were measured for all patients. The quantitative relationship between predictive factors and the probability of ototoxicity were then identified using probit analyses. The primary predictors of ototoxicity on CART analyses were cumulative days of therapy, followed by cumulative area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), which improved on the primary predictor by 87%. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.97 on the test set. Peak and trough were not predictors in any tree. When algorithms were forced to pick peak and trough as primary predictors, the area under the receiver operating curve fell to 0.46. Probit analysis revealed that the probability of ototoxicity increased sharply starting after 6 months of therapy to near maximum at 9 months. A 10% probability of ototoxicity occurred with a threshold cumulative AUC of 87,232 days . mg . h/liter, while that of 20% occurred at 120,000 days . mg . h/liter. Thus, cumulative amikacin AUC and duration of therapy, and not peak and trough concentrations, should be used as the primary decision-making parameters to minimize the likelihood of ototoxicity in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.Copyright © 2015, Modongo et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1128%2fAAC.01050-15,SFX,26248372 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26248372]

Recently, neural stem cells (NSCs) from the cochlear nuclei have been identified, indicating a potential direction for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. Acoustic stimuli play an important role in the development of the auditory system. In this study, we aimed to determine whether acoustic stimuli induce NSC development and differentiation through the upregulation of clusterin (CLU) in NSCs isolated from the cochlear nuclei. To further clarify the underlying mechanisms involved in the development and differentiation of NSCs exposed to acoustic stimuli, we successfully constructed animal models in which was CLU silenced by an intraperitoneal injection of shRNA targeting CLI. As expected, the NSCs from rats treated with LV-CLU shRNA exhibited a lower proliferation ratio when exposed to an augmente d acoustic environment (AAE). Furthermore, the inhibition of cell apoptosis induced by exposure to AAE was abrogated after silencing the expression of the CLU gene. During the differentiation of acoustic stimuli-exposed stem cells into neurons, the number of astrocytes was significantly reduced, as evidenced by the expression of the cell markers, microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which was markedly inhibited when the CLU gene was silenced. Our results indicate that acoustic stimuli may induce the development and differentiation of NSCs from the cochlear nucleus mainly through the CLU pathway.

Here we demonstrate a role of Ras-related in brain 3 (Rab3)-interacting molecules 2alpha and beta (RIM2alpha and RIM2beta) in clustering voltage-gated CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels at the AZs of sensory inner hair cells (IHCs). We show that IHCs of hearing mice express mainly RIM2alpha, but also RIM2beta and RIM3gamma, which all localize to the AZs, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunohistochemistry, patch-clamp, fluctuation analysis, and confocal Ca2+ imaging demonstrate that AZs of RIM2alpha-deficient IHCs cluster fewer synaptic CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels, resulting in reduced synaptic Ca2+ influx. Using superresolution microscopy, we found that Ca2+ channels remained clustered in stripes underneath anchored ribbons. Electron tomography of high-pressure frozen synapses revealed a reduced fraction of membrane-tethered vesicles, whereas the total number of membrane-proximal vesicles was unaltered. Membrane capacitance measurements revealed a reduction of exocytosis largely in proportion with the Ca2+ current, whereas the apparent Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis was unchanged. Hair cell-specific deletion of all RIM2 isoforms caused a stronger reduction of Ca2+ influx and exocytosis and significantly impaired the encoding of sound onset in the postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons. Auditory brainstem responses indicated a mild hearing impairment on hair cell-specific deletion of all RIM2 isoforms or global inactivation of RIM2alpha. We conclude that RIM2alpha and RIM2beta promote a large complement of synaptic Ca2+ channels at IHC AZs and are required for normal hearing.Copyright © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

This study aimed to analyze the potential of artificial neural networks and logistic regression techniques for estimation of hearing impairment among industrial workers. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 210 workers employed in a steel factory (in West of Iran) were selected, and their occupational exposure histories were analyzed. The hearing loss thresholds of the studied workers were determined using a calibrated audiometer. The personal noise exposures were also measured using a noise dosimeter in the workstations. Data obtained from five variables, which can influence the hearing loss, were used as input features, and the hearing loss thresholds were considered as target feature of the prediction methods. Multilayer feedforward neural networks and logistic regression were developed using MATLAB R2011a software. Result(s): Based on the World Health Organization classification for the grades of hearing loss, 74.2% of the studied workers have normal hearing thresholds, 23.4% have slight hearing loss, and 2.4% have moderate hearing loss. The accuracy and kappa coefficient of the best developed neural networks for prediction of the grades of hearing loss were 88.6 and 66.30, respectively. The accuracy and kappa coefficient of the logistic regression were also 84.28 and 51.30, respectively. Conclusion(s): Neural networks could provide more accurate predictions of the hearing loss than logistic regression.

Our objective was to assess preoperative factors and outcomes for paediatric cochlear implant recipients with CHARGE syndrome, to enable better surgical preparation and family counselling. Method(s): The Sydney Cochlear Implant Centre database was searched for children with CHARGE syndrome who had received a cochlear implant at ages 16 and less. Data were collected regarding clinical history; hearing assessments; MRI and CT scan findings; preoperative transtympanic electrical Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR); intraoperative findings and intraoperative electrical ABR and Neural Response Telemetry; and language outcomes in terms of main language used and Categories of Auditory Performance scores (0-7 ranking). Result(s): Ten children were identified. All seven prelingual profoundly deaf children with CHARGE syndrome had hypoplastic or absent auditory nerves bilaterally on MRI scans. Middle ear anatomy was often abnormal, affecting surgical landmarks and making identification of the cochlea very difficult in some cases. Three cases required repeated surgery to obtain successful cochlear implant insertion, one under CT scan image guided technique. All seven children used sign language, or simpler gestures, as their main mode of communication. Two children of of these children, who were implanted early, also attained some spoken language. CAP scores ranged from 0 to 6.The three children with CHARGE syndrome and progressive sensorineural hearing loss had a normal auditory nerve in at least one ear on MRI scans. All had preoperative verbal language, with CAP scores of 6, and continued with CAP scores of 6 following receipt of the cochlear implant. Conclusion(s): Children with CHARGE and congenital profound hearing loss all had hypoplasia or absent auditory nerves, affecting their outcomes with cochlear implants. They often had markedly abnormal middle ear anatomy and CT image guided surgery can be helpful. These children should be offered a bilingual early intervention approach, using sign language and verbal language, to ensure best language outcomes.

Homozygous nonsense mutations cause a severe, early-onset CMT phenotype. However, no other consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported to date. We investigated three unrelated patients presenting with motor developmental delay, hypotonia and hearing loss in the first decade of life. Slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness and sensory loss subsequently developed. Examination between ages 15-40 years also revealed marked sensory ataxia, and two patients had cerebellar involvement based on neurological and neuro-otological examination or brain MRI. In all cases, brainstem auditory evoked potentials were abnormal and nerve conduction studies were consistent with a motor and sensory neuropathy with upper limb motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV) in the 25-35 m/s range. Sural nerve biopsy in one patient revealed marked loss of large myelinated fibres with occasional regeneration clusters and onion bulb formation. Direct sequencing of the NEFL gene confirmed a heterozygous de novo pathogenic mutation N98S in all three patients. Five additional sporadic CMT cases caused by the N98S mutation were identified from the literature. The mutation was confirmed de novo in one case. Four patients presented with motor delay and three of them had hearing impairment. Most cases had additional features including growth retardation, intellectual impairment, hypotonia, nystagmus or wide-based gait. MNCV were in the 22-29m/s range in all patients. Our observation suggests that the NEFL mutation N98S usually arises de novo and causes a consistent phenotype of severe, early-onset CMT1 associated with CNS features such as hearing loss, cerebellar signs or intellectual impairment.

This study sought to identify potential risk profiles for patients most at risk of developing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Methodology: A retrospective review of 150 patients with HNC, who received definitive CbCRT, was undertaken. Patients with pre-treatment otologic problems were specifically excluded. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters within the data and regression models to determine the relative contributions of variables including patient and tumour characteristics, pre-treatment hearing thresholds and treatment parameters. Result(s): Of the 150 patients reviewed, 139 patients were suitable for analysis and of these, only 34.7% received audiometry testing. The mean hearing deterioration at pure-tone average 1-2-4 kHz was mild (from 22.4 dB HL to 27.6 dB HL). However, individual patients demonstrated clinically significant hearing loss, with 10 dB threshold shifts in 80 %, 53.3 % and 31.1 % at pure-tone average 0.5-1-2 kHz, 1-2-4 kHz and 8 kHz, respectively. PCA indicated two risk profiles: (1) low or medium frequency SNHL and, (2) high frequency SNHL. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tobacco consumption (rho < 0.006) and alcohol intake (rho < 0.08) significantly predicted high frequency SNHL (F(3,33) = 3.59, rho < 0.02, R2 = 0.177), with cumulative cisplatin dose (rho < 0.006) significantly predicting low and medium frequency SNHL (F(3,34) = 14.81, rho < 0.001, R2 = 0.528). Conclusion(s): Whilst SNHL rates may be under reported without routine audiometry, the incidence of CbCRT-induced SNHL, in HNC patients, in this study, is high.

Although several risk factors have been identified, its etiogenesis has not been clarified yet. Dorsal cochlear nuclei (DCN) show changes in plasticity that are thought to be necessary for tinnitus onset but not after its chronicization (Brozoski et al. 2011). One of the major problems in animal tinnitus models is the unreliability of tinnitus induction protocols: a large fraction of treated animals, in fact, do not develop the symptom (Koehler and Shore 2013), and tinnitus is also often associated with deafness and/or hyperacusia, which complicate interpretation of results. After noise trauma, neural plasticity in DCN fusiform cells appears associated to actual tinnitus presence (Koehler and Shore 2013). We investigated the possible involvement of microglia in tinnitus-associated aberrant DCN plasticity. In our experiments we induced tinnitus with unilateral cochlear destruction, noise trauma or salicylate and observed Iba-1 immunofluorescence in DCN slices by confocal microscopy. Although all treatments were able to induce tinnitus (tested as in Turner 2006), DCN microglial responses of tinnitus-positive animals were different: after salicyilate treatment, microglia significantly increased in density (from 117.3+47.2, n=15 to 215.3+54.8 cell/mm2, n=18), but did not show activation signs, whereas after cochlear destruction, microglia showed a larger increase in density (maximal in the ipsilateral nucleus after 5 days, 466,4+185,7; n=14) and clear signs of activation. After noise trauma, microglia became less uniformly distributed, showing a cluster in the DCN region corresponding to noise trauma frequencies (n=1). Microglia activation after cochlear destruction was necessary for tinnitus onset: in animals treated with minocycline after surgery, neither microgliosis (after 5 days, ipsilateral DCN density was 144.1+33.4, n=5) nor behavioural signs of tinnitus were observed. On the other hand, salicylate-induced tinnitus was not dependent on microglia activation, since behavioural signs of tinnitus were observed after treatment with salicylate and minocycline (n=2). Our results suggest that DCN microglia follows different functional pathways upon different tinnitusinducing treatment. A similar or even larger heterogeneity in human tinnitus population would agree with the wide variability of different treatment efficacy.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1002%2fglia.22870,SFX,

Patients from rural regions may have many barriers to timely diagnosis and intervention. The purpose of this study was to examine the spatial and hospital-based distribution of failed infant hearing screening testing and pediatric congenital hearing loss throughout Kentucky.
DESIGN: Data on live births and audiological reporting of infant hearing loss results in Kentucky from 2009 to 2011 were analyzed. The authors used spatial scan statistics to identify high-rate clusters of failed newborn screening tests and permanent congenital hearing loss (PCHL), based on the total number of live births per county. The authors conducted further analyses on PCHL and failed newborn hearing screening tests, based on birth hospital data and method of screening.
RESULTS: The authors observed four statistically significant (p < 0.05) high-rate clusters with failed newborn hearing screenings in Kentucky, including two in the Appalachian region. Hospitals using two-stage otoacoustic emission testing demonstrated higher rates of failed screening (p = 0.009) than those using two-stage automated auditory brainstem response testing. A significant cluster of high rate of PCHL was observed in Western Kentucky. Five of the 54 birthing hospitals were found to have higher relative risk of PCHL, and two of those hospitals are located in a very rural region of Western Kentucky within the cluster.
CONCLUSIONS: This spatial analysis in children in Kentucky has identified specific regions throughout the state with high rates of congenital hearing loss and failed newborn hearing screening tests. Further investigation regarding causative factors is warranted. This method of analysis can be useful in the setting of hearing health disparities to focus efforts on regions facing high incidence of congenital hearing loss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000101,SFX,25225918 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25225918]

The primary purpose of this article is to quantify aided speech audibility during the early childhood years and examine the factors that influence audibility with amplification for children in the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss study.
DESIGN: Participants were 288 children with permanent hearing loss who were followed as part of the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss study. All of the children in this analysis had bilateral hearing loss and wore air-conduction behind-the-ear HAs. At every study visit, hearing thresholds were measured using developmentally appropriate behavioral methods. Data were obtained for a total of 1043 audiometric evaluations across all subjects for the first four study visits. In addition, the aided audibility of speech through the HA was assessed using probe microphone measures. Hearing thresholds and aided audibility were analyzed. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted to determine whether patterns of thresholds and aided audibility were significantly different between ears (left versus right) or across the first four study visits. Furthermore, a cluster analysis was performed based on the aided audibility at entry into the study, aided audibility at the child's final visit, and change in aided audibility between these two intervals to determine whether there were different patterns of longitudinal aided audibility within the sample.
RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of children in the study had stable audiometric thresholds during the study, defined as threshold changes <10 dB for any single study visit. There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds, aided audibility, or deviation of the HA fitting from prescriptive targets between ears or across test intervals for the first four visits. Approximately 35% of the children in the study had aided audibility that was below the average for the normative range for the Speech Intelligibility Index based on degree of hearing loss. The cluster analysis of longitudinal aided audibility revealed three distinct groups of children: a group with consistently high aided audibility throughout the study, a group with decreasing audibility during the study, and a group with consistently low aided audibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that approximately 65% of children in the study had adequate aided audibility of speech and stable hearing during the study period. Limited audibility was associated with greater degrees of hearing loss and larger deviations from prescriptive targets. Studies of developmental outcomes will help to determine how aided audibility is necessary to affect developmental outcomes in children who are hard of hearing.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000211,SFX,26731156 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26731156]

One of the most important considerations for implementing these algorithms into devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants involves their ability to generalize to conditions not employed during the training stage. A major challenge involves the generalization to novel noise segments. In the current study, sentences were segregated from multi-talker babble and from cafeteria noise using an algorithm that employs deep neural networks to estimate the ideal ratio mask. Importantly, the algorithm was trained on segments of noise and tested using entirely novel segments of the same nonstationary noise type. Substantial sentence-intelligibility benefit was observed for hearing-impaired listeners in both noise types, despite the use of unseen noise segments during the test stage. Interestingly, normal-hearing listeners displayed benefit in babble but not in cafeteria noise. This result highlights the importance of evaluating these algorithms not only in human subjects, but in members of the actual target population.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1121%2f1.4929493,SFX,26428803 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26428803]

Artificial intelligence, as a new approach, can be used to predict the complex phenomenon such as hearing loss. Using artificial neural networks, this study aims to present an empirical model for the prediction of the hearing loss threshold among noise-exposed workers.
METHODS: Two hundred and ten workers employed in a steel factory were chosen, and their occupational exposure histories were collected. To determine the hearing loss threshold, the audiometric test was carried out using a calibrated audiometer. The personal noise exposure was also measured using a noise dosimeter in the workstations of workers. Finally, data obtained five variables, which can influence the hearing loss, were used for the development of the prediction model. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks with different structures were developed using MATLAB software. Neural network structures had one hidden layer with the number of neurons being approximately between 5 and 15 neurons.
RESULTS: The best developed neural networks with one hidden layer and ten neurons could accurately predict the hearing loss threshold with RMSE = 2.6 dB and R(2) = 0.89. The results also confirmed that neural networks could provide more accurate predictions than multiple regressions.
CONCLUSIONS: Since occupational hearing loss is frequently non-curable, results of accurate prediction can be used by occupational health experts to modify and improve noise exposure conditions.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1007%2fs00420-014-1004-z,SFX,25432298 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25432298]

However, some longitudinal studies point to low help-seeking and subsequent rehabilitation after a failed hearing screening (positive screening result). Some barriers to help-seeking and rehabilitation could be intrinsic to the profiles and needs of people who have failed a hearing screening. Theories of health behavior change could help to understand this population. One of these theories is the transtheoretical (stages-of-change) model of health behavior change, which describes profiles and needs of people facing behavior changes such as seeking help and taking up rehabilitation. According to this model, people go through distinct stages toward health behavior change: precontemplation, contemplation, action, and finally, maintenance. The present study describes the psychometric properties (construct validity) of the stages of change in adults who have failed an online hearing screening. Stages of change were measured with the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA). Principal component analysis is presented, along with cluster analysis. Internal consistency was investigated. Finally, relationships between URICA scores and speech-in-noise recognition threshold, self-reported hearing disability, and self-reported duration of hearing disability are presented.
DESIGN: In total, 224 adults who had failed a Swedish online hearing screening test (measure of speech-in-noise recognition) completed further questionnaires online, including the URICA.
RESULTS: A principal component analysis identified the stages of precontemplation, contemplation, and action, plus an additional stage, termed preparation (between contemplation and action). According to the URICA, half (50%) of the participants were in the preparation stage of change. The contemplation stage was represented by 38% of participants, while 9% were in the precontemplation stage. Finally, the action stage was represented by approximately 3% of the participants. Cluster analysis identified four stages-of-change clusters: they were named decision making (44% of sample), participation (28% of sample), indecision (16% of sample), and reluctance (12% of sample). The construct validity of the model was good. Participants who reported a more advanced stage of change had significantly greater self-reported hearing disability. However, participants who reported a more advanced stage of change did not have a significantly worse speech-in-noise recognition threshold or reported a significantly longer duration of hearing impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: The additional stage this study uncovered, and which other studies have also uncovered, preparation, highlights the need for adequate guidance for adults who are yet to seek help for their hearing. The fact that very few people were in the action stage (approximately 3% of the sample) signals that screening alone is unlikely to be enough to improve help-seeking and rehabilitation rates. As expected, people in the later stages of change reported significantly greater hearing disability. The lack of significant relationships between stages-of-change measures and speech-in-noise recognition threshold and self-reported duration of hearing disability highlights the complex interplay between impairment, disability, and behaviors in adults who have failed an online hearing screening and who are yet to seek help.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&DO=10.1097%2fAUD.0000000000000085,SFX,25158981 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25158981]

METHOD: Electronic databases PubMed, YZ365. COM, WANFANG DATA, CMJD, CHKD, CNKI were searched using relevant keywords. Extracted data included author, year of publication, diagnosis, et al. Reported treatment outcomes were clustered into speech discrimination and hearing abilities. Meta-analyses were performed on studies with numerical results using random or fixed effects model.
RESULT: There were eight randomized control studies including 442 patients. Comparing speech perception of prelingually deaf children after cochlear implantation younger than three years old (experimental group) and 3-6 years old (control group), three and six months after operation showed that experimental group performed significantly worse than control group; 12 months after operation showed that experimental group performed significantly better than control group. Comparing hearing abilities, three and six months after operation showed that experimental group performed significantly worse than control group; 12 months after operation showed showed that experimental group performed significantly better than control group. Comparing speech perception of younger or older than 4. 5 years old children showed that after 1.5-2 years of operation children implanted younger than 4.5 years of age performed significantly better than children implanted older than 4.5 years old. Comparing speech perception of 7-12 years old children showed that after 3, 6, 12 months of operation patients of 7-12 years old performed significantly better than those children older than 12 years old. Comparing speech perception of implantation younger or older than 18 years old (7-14 yeas old was group A, > 14-18 yeas old was group B, older than 18 yeas old was group C) showed that after one and four years of operation A > B > C, and there were significant differences among them. Comparing warble tone threshold average (WTA) showed that after one year of operation A < B < C, and there were significant differences among them. However, after four years of operation, there was no significant difference among them.
CONCLUSION: Prelinguistically deafened patients younger than three years old with cochlear implantation, insisting on scienctific rehabilitation training for a long period of time can receive the optimal recovery effect. The older patients are suggested as early as possible receiving cochlear implantation. The longer they are implanted, the better results they will receive. Moreover, the younger age they are implanted, the faster postoperative language progress they will receive. Further controlled studies with longer follow-up periods and more person included may make the effectiveness of cochlear implantaion more reliable.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&AN=607907313,SFX,26121827 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26121827]

To investigate morphological changes in these brains voxel-based morphometry, voxel-wise correlation with the primary auditory cortex, and whole brain network analyses using morphological covariance were performed in eight prelingual deaf, eleven postlingual deaf, and eleven hearing adults. Network characteristics based on graph theory and network filtration based on persistent homology were examined. Gray matter density in the primary auditor cortex was preserved in prelingual deafness, while it tended to decrease in postlingual deafness. Unlike postlingual, prelingual deafness showed increased bilateral temporal connectivity of the primary auditory cortex compared to the hearing adults.Of the graph theory-based characteristics, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and nodal efficiency all increased in prelingual deafness, while all the parameters of postlingual deafness were similar to the hearing adults. Patterns of connected components changing during network filtration were different between prelingual deafness and hearing adults according to the barcode, dendrogram, and single linkage matrix representations, while these were the same in postlingual deafness. Nodes in fronto-limbic and left temporal components were closely coupled, and nodes in the temporo-parietal component were loosely coupled, in prelingual deafness. Patterns of connected components changing in postlingual deafness were the same as hearing adults. We propose that the preserved density of auditory cortex associated with increased connectivity in prelingual deafness, and closer coupling between certain brain areas, represent distinctive reorganization of auditory and related cortices compared with hearing or postlingual deaf adults. The differential network reorganization in the prelingual deaf adults could be related to the absence of auditory speech experience. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2014.06.007,SFX,25016143 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25016143]

Neonatal deafening results in loss of the normal cochleotopic organization of the primary auditory cortex (AI), but environmentally-derived intracochlear electrical stimulation, via a cochlear implant, initiated shortly after deafening, can prevent this loss. We investigated whether such stimulation initiated after an extended period of deafness can restore cochleotopy. In two groups of neonatally-deafened cats, a multi-channel intracochlear electrode array was implanted at 8 weeks of age. One group received only minimal stimulation, associated with brief recordings at 4-6-week intervals, over the following 6 months to check the efficacy of the implant. In the other group, this 6-month period was followed by 6 months of near-continuous intracochlear electrical stimulation from a modified clinical cochlear implant system. We recorded multi-unit clusters in the auditory cortex and used two different methods to define the region of interest in the putative AI. There was no evidence of cochleotopy in any of the minimally stimulated animals, confirming our earlier finding. In three of six chronically stimulated cats there was clear evidence of AI cochleotopy, and in a fourth cat in which the majority of penetrations were in the anterior auditory field there was clear evidence of cochleotopy in that field. The finding that chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation after an extended period of deafness is able to restore cochleotopy in some (but not all) cases has implications for the performance of patients implanted after an extended period of deafness. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&DO=10.1111%2fejn.12445,SFX,24325274 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24325274]

It identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport. Research Design: This observational study recruited adult hearing aid users from 22 private dispensers in the Netherlands and in Denmark. Study Sample: The sample consisted of 228 hearing aid users. Typical participants were over the age of 65 and retired, were fitted binaurally, and had financially contributed to the cost of their hearing aids. Participants had on average a mild-to-severe sloping bilateral hearing impairment. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants completed a purposefully designed questionnaire regarding hearing aid usage and the International Outcome Inventory - Hearing Aids. Dispensers collected audiometric results and data logging. Multiple linear regression identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport when controlling for covariates. Result(s): Data logging showed on average 10.5 hr of hearing aid use (n = 184), while participants reported on average 11.8 hr of daily hearing aid use (n = 206). In participants for which both data-logged and self-reported hearing aid use data were available (n = 166), the average absolute overreport of daily hearing aid use was 1.2 (1 hr and 11 min). Relative overreport was expressed as a rate of absolute overreport divided by data-logged hearing aid use. A positive rate denotes hearing aid use overreport: the average overreport rate was .38. Cluster analysis identified two data-logged patterns: ""Regular,"" where hearing aids are typically switched on for between 12 and 20 hr before their user powers them off (57% of the sample), and ""On-off,"" where hearing aids are typically switched on for shorter periods of time before being powered off (43% of the sample). In terms of self-report, 77% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be the same every day, while 23% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be different from day to day. Participants for whom data logging showed an On-off pattern or who reported their hearing aid use to be different from day to day had significantly fewer data-logged and self-reported hours of hearing aid use. Having an On-off data-logging pattern or describing hearing aid use as the same every day was associated with a significantly greater hearing aid use overreport. Conclusion(s): Data-logged and self-reported usage patterns significantly predicted data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and overreport when controlling for covariates.

Surprisingly, in the inner ear, Cay1.3 is indispensable for signal transmission from the cochlear inner hair cells to the postsynaptic auditory nerve fibers. Due to Cav1.3 channel clustering at ribbons, i.e. specific presynaptic structures of the hair cells, they promote Ca2+influx which triggers calcium-dependent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. Consequently, mutations in Cacnald, the gene that encodes Cay1.3, cause deafness. Additionally, Cay1.3 plays an important part in the central auditory system. Lack of the channel results in severe changes in auditory pathway cytoarchitecture and in abnormal electrophysiological performance of auditory neurons. Furthermore, developmental refinement of tonotopic inhibitory projections in sound localization circuits is disrupted. These aberrations are associated with abnormal sound processing in the auditory pathway. Cacnald therefore represents a prototypal deafness associated gene, in which mutations result in both peripheral and central auditory deficiencies. This, in turn, has implications for auditory rehabilitation using cochlear implants which address only peripheral dysfunctions. Exploratory research into the closely related Cay1.2 isoform points to an important role of this channel in acoustic trauma. Cay1.2 is mainly expressed in the auditory nerve, but apparently not essential for normal auditory function. Rather, loss of function of the channel does influence the effects of traumatic noise exposure. Loss of this channel induced by noise trauma results in reduced auditory threshold increase. This phenomenon points to the fact that Cay1.2-mediated Ca2+ influx is involved in noise trauma induced damage. Deeper insight into this function might result in new therapeutic approaches.Copyright © Springer Verlag 2014.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&AN=600226677,SFX,

Here we report the generation of a mouse model for a connexin 26 (Cx26) mutation, in which cre-Sox10 drives excision of the Cx26 gene from non-sensory cells flanking the auditory epithelium. We determined that these conditional knockout mice, designated Gjb2-CKO, have a severe hearing loss. Immunocytochemistry of the auditory epithelium confirmed absence of Cx26 in the non-sensory cells. Histology of the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) performed at ages 1, 3, or 6 months revealed that in Gjb2-CKO mice, the organ of Corti began to degenerate in the basal cochlear turn at an early stage, and the degeneration rapidly spread to the apex. In addition, the density of SGNs in Rosenthal's canal decreased rapidly along a gradient from the base of the cochlea to the apex, where some SGNs survived until at least 6 months of age. Surviving neurons often clustered together and formed clumps of cells in the canal. We then assessed the influence of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene therapy on the SGNs of Gjb2-CKO mice by inoculating Adenovirus with the BDNF gene insert (Ad.BDNF) into the base of the cochlea via the scala tympani or scala media. We determined that over-expression of BDNF beginning around 1 month of age resulted in a significant rescue of neurons in Rosenthal's canal of the cochlear basal turn but not in the middle or apical portions. This data may be used to design therapies for enhancing the SGN physiological status in all GJB2 patients and especially in a sub-group of GJB2 patients where the hearing loss progresses due to ongoing degeneration of the auditory nerve, thereby improving the outcome of cochlear implant therapy in these ears. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2013.11.009,SFX,24333301 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24333301]

Conclusion(s): The presence of noise-limiting technology in the workplace, the variation in the nature of the acoustic incident involved (ranging from a shriek, through feedback noise, to a male voice), and the marked variation in the time of symptom onset (following the acoustic incident) all suggest that the condition termed acoustic shock is predominantly psychogenic. Cases of pseudohypacusis indicate that malingering is a factor in some cases. Clusters of acoustic shock events occurring in the same call centres suggest that hysteria may play a part. The condition is usually only seen when work-related issues are apparent.

Using a prospective design, the range and accuracy of consonant clusters produced by a homogenous cohort of 12 children early-identified with severe/profound HL aged 3- and 4-years were examined. All children demonstrated bilateral aided thresholds within a range of 15-25 dB HL across all frequencies, were optimally amplified with cochlear implants (11/12) or hearing aids (1/12), and attended auditory-verbal (AV) early intervention. Standardized speech and language assessments were administered. Consonant clusters were strategically sampled in single-word and conversational speech contexts. All standard scores for speech, receptive, and expressive language were within normal limits. All children produced consonant clusters commensurate with expectations for typically-developing hearing peers at 3- and 4- years-of-age. Children's production of phonetically complex morphophonemes (final consonant clusters marking grammatical morphemes) was also in keeping with developmental expectations.

The aim of this study was to determine if these SNPs are also associated with ARHI in an elderly male Han Chinese population. In this case-control candidate genes association study, a total of 982 men with ARHI and 324 normal-hearing controls subjects were studied. Using K-means cluster analysis, four audiogram shape subtypes of ARHI were identified in the case group: ''flat shape (FL)'', ''sloping shape (SL)'', ''2-4 kHz abrupt loss (AL) shape'' and ''8 kHz dip (8D) shape''. Results suggested that the SNP rs11928865 (A>T) of GRM7 was significantly associated with ARHI after adjusting for non-genetic factors (p= 0.000472, OR= 1.599, 95%CI= 1.229~2.081). Furthermore, frequency of TT genotype (rs11928865) were significant higher in the SL subgroup and AL subgroup with compared to controls group (p= 9.41E-05, OR= 1.945, 95%CI= 1.393~2.715; p= 0.000109, OR= 1.915, 95%CI= 1.378~2.661 adjusted, respectively) after Bonferroni correction. However, there wasn't significant difference in the frequency of the TT genotype between cases in the FL subgroup or the 8D subgroup with when compared with controls.

Box 211, Amsterdam 1000 AE, Netherlands)","High doses of sodium salicylate (SS) have long been known to induce temporary hearing loss and tinnitus, effects attributed to cochlear dysfunction. However, our recent publications reviewed here show that SS can induce profound, permanent, and unexpected changes in the cochlea and central nervous system. Prolonged treatment with SS permanently decreased the cochlear compound action potential (CAP) amplitude in vivo. In vitro, high dose SS resulted in a permanent loss of spiral ganglion neurons and nerve fibers, but did not damage hair cells. Acute treatment with high-dose SS produced a frequency-dependent decrease in the amplitude of distortion product otoacoustic emissions and CAP. Losses were greatest at low and high frequencies, but least at the mid-frequencies (10-20 kHz), the mid-frequency band that corresponds to the tinnitus pitch measured behaviorally. In the auditory cortex, medial geniculate body and amygdala, high-dose SS enhanced sound-evoked neural responses at high stimulus levels, but it suppressed activity at low intensities and elevated response threshold. When SS was applied directly to the auditory cortex or amygdala, it only enhanced sound evoked activity, but did not elevate response threshold. Current source density analysis revealed enhanced current flow into the supragranular layer of auditory cortex following systemic SS treatment. Systemic SS treatment also altered tuning in auditory cortex and amygdala; low frequency and high frequency multiunit clusters up-shifted or down-shifted their characteristic frequency into the 10-20 kHz range thereby altering auditory cortex tonotopy and enhancing neural activity at mid-frequencies corresponding to the tinnitus pitch. These results suggest that SS-induced hyperactivity in auditory cortex originates in the central nervous system, that the amygdala potentiates these effects and that the SS-induced tonotopic shifts in auditory cortex, the putative neural correlate of tinnitus, arises from the interaction between the frequency-dependent losses in the cochlea and hyperactivity in the central nervous system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2012.11.016,SFX,23201030 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23201030]

Results from animal models detailing the effects of specific cochlear injuries on audiometric profiles may be used to understand the mechanisms underlying hearing loss in older humans and predict cochlear pathologies associated with certain audiometric configurations (""audiometric phenotypes""). Patterns of hearing loss associated with cochlear pathology in animal models were used to define schematic boundaries of human audiograms. Pathologies included evidence for metabolic, sensory, and a mixed metabolic + sensory phenotype; an older normal phenotype without threshold elevation was also defined. Audiograms from a large sample of older adults were then searched by a human expert for ""exemplars"" (best examples) of these phenotypes, without knowledge of the human subject demographic information. Mean thresholds and slopes of higher frequency thresholds of the audiograms assigned to the four phenotypes were consistent with the predefined schematic boundaries and differed significantly from each other. Significant differences in age, gender, and noise exposure history provided external validity for the four phenotypes. Three supervised machine learning classifiers were then used to assess reliability of the exemplar training set to estimate the probability that newly obtained audiograms exhibited one of the four phenotypes. These procedures classified the exemplars with a high degree of accuracy; classifications of the remaining cases were consistent with the exemplars with respect to average thresholds and demographic information.

Perceptual grouping mechanisms are essential to segregate concurrent sound sources and affect Comodulation Masking Release (CMR). Thus, CMR measurements in CI users could shed light on segregation cues needed for forming and grouping of auditory objects. CMR illustrates the fact that detection of a target sound embedded in a fluctuating masker is improved by the addition of masker energy remote from the target frequency, provided the envelope fluctuations across masker components are coherent. We modified such a CMR experiment to electrically-induced hearing using direct stimulation and measured the effect in 21 CI users. Cluster analysis of our data revealed two groups: one showed no or only small CMR of 0.1 dB +/- 2.7 (N = 14) and a second group achieved a CMR of 10.7 dB +/- 3.2 (N = 7), a value that is close to the enhancement observed in a comparable acoustic experiment in normal-hearing listeners (12.9 dB +/- 2.6, N = 6). Interestingly, we observed that CMR in CI users may relate to hearing etiology and duration of hearing loss pre-implantation. Our study demonstrates for the first time that a substantial minority of cochlear-implant listeners (about a third) can show significant CMR. This outcome motivates the development of physiologically inspired multi-band gain control and/or different coding strategies for these groups in order to better preserve coherent modulation and thus to take advantage of the individual remaining capabilities to analyze spectro-temporal patterns. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&DO=10.1016%2fj.heares.2012.11.023,SFX,23220120 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23220120]

Our subject displays severely deficient expressive language, stereotypic and repetitive behaviours, mild intellectual disability (ID), focal epilepsy, short stature and absence of significant dysmorphic features. Search of the PubMed literature and DECIPHER database identified 4 additional cases involving 18q12.1 associated with autism and/or ID that overlap our case: one duplication, two deletions and one balanced translocation.

Result(s): From WES data, we identified five distinct CNV loci from a NSHL family, but they were not co-segregated among patients. Linkage analysis based on SNVs identified six candidate loci (logarithm of odds [LOD] >1.5).

The auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia consist of mechanically sensitive hair cells and associated supporting cells. Hearing loss and balance dysfunction are most frequently caused by compromise of hair cells and/or their innervating neurons. The development of gene- and cell-based therapeutics will benefit from a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of patterning and cell fate specification in the mammalian inner ear. This includes analyses of cell lineages and cell dispersals across anatomical boundaries (such as sensory versus nonsensory territories). The goal of this study was to conduct retroviral lineage analysis of the embryonic day 11.5(E11.5) mouse otic vesicle. A replication-defective retrovirus encoding human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and a variable 24-bp oligonucleotide tag was microinjected into the E11.5 mouse otocyst. PLAP-positive cells were microdissected from cryostat sections of the postnatal inner ear and subjected to nested PCR. PLAP-positive cells sharing the same sequence tag were assumed to have arisen from a common progenitor and are clonally related. Thirty five multicellular clones consisting of an average of 3.4 cells per clone were identified in the auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia, ganglia, spiral limbus, and stria vascularis. Vestibular hair cells in the posterior crista were related to one another, their supporting cells, and nonsensory epithelial cells lining the ampulla. In the organ of Corti, outer hair cells were related to a supporting cell type and were tightly clustered. By contrast, spiral ganglion neurons, interdental cells, and Claudius' cells were related to cells of the same type and could be dispersed over hundreds of microns.

ADNSHL displays a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and varying rates of progression. Accurate, comprehensive, and cost-effective genetic testing facilitates genetic counseling and provides valuable prognostic information to affected individuals. In this article, we describe the algorithm underlying AudioGene, a software system employing machine-learning techniques that utilizes phenotypic information derived from audiograms to predict the genetic cause of hearing loss in persons segregating ADNSHL. Our data show that AudioGene has an accuracy of 68% in predicting the causative gene within its top three predictions, as compared with 44% for a majority classifier. We also show that AudioGene remains effective for audiograms with high levels of clinical measurement noise. We identify audiometric outliers for each genetic locus and hypothesize that outliers may reflect modifying genetic effects. As personalized genomic medicine becomes more common, AudioGene will be increasingly useful as a phenotypic filter to assess pathogenicity of variants identified by massively parallel sequencing.

Cluster analysis revealed five types of communication disabilities of AD; generally preserved, with hearing difficulty, with cognitive deficits, with articulatory difficulty, and generally impaired. 2. Support strategies for communicative problems of AD individuals with hearing difficulty 1) Factors determining application of a hearing aid Fifty one individuals with probable AD who were using a hearing aid received PTA, MMSE, word recognition test (WRT), and Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly. Factors determining the application of a hearing aid included preserved auditory word recognition and attention.

Method(s): This study was conducted at the Center for Audiological Research at the University of Sao Paulo. The sample included 14 pediatric (4-11 years of age) cochlear implant users with ANSD, of both sexes, with profound prelingual hearing loss. Patients with hypoplasia or agenesis of the auditory nerve were excluded from the study. LLAEPs produced in response to speech stimuli were recorded using a Smart EP USB Jr. system. The subjects' speech perception was evaluated using tests 5 and 6 of the Glendonald Auditory Screening Procedure (GASP). Result(s): The P1 component was detected in 12/14 (85.7%) children with ANSD. Latency of the P1 component correlated with duration of sensorial hearing deprivation (*p=0.007, r=0.7278), but not with duration of cochlear implant use. An analysis of groups assigned according to GASP performance (k-means clustering) revealed that aspects of prior central auditory system development reflected in the P1 component are related to behavioral auditory skills.

The long primary RNA transcript of the miR-376 RNA cluster members undergo extensive and simultaneous A -> I editing at one or both of two specific sites (+4 and +44) in particular human and mouse tissues. The PRPS1 gene, which contains target sites for the edited version of miR-376a-5p within its 3'UTR, has been shown to be repressed in a tissue-specific manner. To investigate whether the transcription of Prps1 is regulated by miR-376 cluster members in the mouse inner ear, we first quantified the expression of the mature miR-376 RNAs by quantitative real-time-PCR. The spatio-temporal patterns of miR-376 expression were assessed by in situ hybridization. Finally, we examined whether A ->I editing of pri-miR-376 RNAs occurs in mouse inner ear by direct sequencing. Our data showed that the miR-376a-3p, b-3p, c-3p are present in mouse embryonic inner ears and intensive expression of miR-376a-3p/b-3p was detected in the sensory epithelia and ganglia of both auditory and vestibular portions of the inner ear.

Yet, relationships between the changes in DPOAE metrics and auditory sensitivity are still poorly understood. Explicating these relationships might support the use of DPOAEs in hearing conservation programs (HCPs) for detecting early damage leading to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) so that mitigating steps might be taken to limit any lasting damage. This report describes the development of DPOAE-based statistical models to assess the risk of hearing loss from cisplatin treatment among cancer patients. Ototoxicity risk assessment (ORA) models were constructed using a machine learning paradigm in which partial least squares and leave-one-out cross-validation were applied, yielding optimal screening algorithms from a set of known risk factors for ototoxicity and DPOAE changes from pre-exposure baseline measures. Single DPOAE metrics alone were poorer indicators of the risk of ototoxic hearing shifts than the best performing multivariate models. This finding suggests that multivariate approaches applied to the use of DPOAEs in a HCP, will improve the ability of DPOAE measures to identify ears with noise-induced mechanical damage and/or hearing loss at each monitoring interval.

Stilp and colleagues recently reported efficient coding of robust correlation (r =. 97) among complex acoustic attributes (attack/decay, spectral shape) in novel sounds. Discrimination of sounds orthogonal to the correlation was initially inferior but later comparable to that of sounds obeying the correlation. These effects were attenuated for less-correlated stimuli (r =. 54) for reasons that are unclear. Here, statistical properties of correlation among acoustic attributes essential for perceptual organization are investigated. Overall, simple strength of the principal correlation is inadequate to predict listener performance. Initial superiority of discrimination for statistically consistent sound pairs was relatively insensitive to decreased physical acoustic/psychoacoustic range of evidence supporting the correlation, and to more frequent presentations of the same orthogonal test pairs. However, increased range supporting an orthogonal dimension has substantial effects upon perceptual organization. Connectionist simulations and Eigenvalues from closed-form calculations of principal components analysis (PCA) reveal that perceptual organization is near-optimally weighted to shared versus unshared covariance in experienced sound distributions. Implications of reduced perceptual dimensionality for speech perception and plausible neural substrates are discussed. © 2012 Stilp.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0030845,SFX,22292057 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22292057]

However, five months after the surgery, he developed bouts of severe prolonged wholebody shaking immediately following certain auditory stimuli such as loud noises, voices, but not music. When the implant was off, almost any noise (except classical music) delivered to right ear caused these spells, and with implant set at 0.3 or above of maximum intensity, left ear was also susceptible. Previously active and athletic, he had to abandon most of his activities, since these frequent events were very disabling, terminating with a day-long holocephalic headache and prostration. He kept his implant mostly off, and his right ear firmly plugged. He was referred for evaluation by an epileptologist. Method(s): Routine EEG was obtained. Long-term video EEG monitoring was performed, with multiple typical events captured, provoked incidentally, by environmental noises, or purposefully, by examiners. SPECT scans, ictal and interictal, were obtained, and an interictal FDGPET study was done. SSEPs and BAERs were recorded with and without auditory provocation. MRI and MEG were not possible due to the implant. Result(s): Routine EEG revealed left temporal wicket waves and an asymmetry suggestive of left temporal breach rhythm. Video EEG monitoring captured episodes of mostly axial severe dysrythmic myoclonus with onset less than one second after auditory stimulus such as shutting the door, with his implant on or with his right ear unplugged. He was also reliably provoking spells by talking, and by other expected, nonstartling noises. Spells came in clusters of 2-10 minutes of dysrythmic coarse whole-body jerking, accompanied later into the spell by lacrimation and facial flushing. He was able to talk between jerks. SPECT scan showed increased ictal uptake in right posterior insula and in the right mesial structures. PET revealed hypometabolism interictally in right mesiolateral temporal cortex. SSEPS were normal, BAERs were uninterpretable. Conclusion(s): The combination of SPECT and PET findings, as well as a definite clinical delay between the stimulus and the event, suggests that the spells are indeed due to cortically induced myoclonus with right temporal and insular foci. Areas 41 and 42, primary auditory cortex, probably ""ignite"" the initial reflex axial myoclonus response; autonomic events such as flushing and lacrimation suggest secondary insular involvement. Given the temporal association with the cochlear implant, a causal relationship is not excluded, possibly with sensitization and epileptic recruitment of primary auditory cortex.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=70829268,SFX,

Immunofluorescence assay of phospho-c-Jun and the proapoptotic mediators, cleaved caspase-3, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (Endo G) were performed. Analysis of HC density confirmed the safety of mannitol at concentration ranges of 1 to 100 mM. The ototoxic effect of TNFalpha was demonstrated (p < 0.05).

In the second part of this study, the number of SSQ items was reduced to five to make this questionnaire available for routine usage in clinical settings and for screening purposes. : SSQ responses derived from 103 normal-hearing 18- to 25-year-old persons were compared with the SSQ responses of 24 clinically normal-hearing (all thresholds between 125 and 8000 Hz <=25 dB HL) and 109 healthy, 55- to 65-year-old persons with age-related hearing impairment to determine the prevalence and profile of hearing disability. The 45 items of the SSQ were reduced to five by cluster analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. The robustness of this five-item version (SSQ5) was determined in three control populations: an adult 25- to 55-year-old population (n = 159), an ENT-patient population (n = 60), and a population of hearing aid candidates (n = 50). The feasibility of the SSQ5 for screening was compared with the feasibility of the simple question ""Do you have hearing loss?"" by determining, respectively, the sensitivity, specificity, and maximum achievable discriminatory power for predicting hearing status according to speech-in-noise performance. : Prevalence numbers showed data of healthy, middle-aged persons with significant disability, despite minimal impairment (25%) versus data of middle-aged persons with significant impairment and nevertheless, minimal disability (61%). The profile of hearing disability seemed similar in all normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subgroups (i.e., most problems with understanding speech especially in noise conditions, and least problems with sound quality). Compared with the single question: ""Do you have hearing loss?"" the use of the SSQ5 had 37% more maximum discriminatory power for determining hearing status category based on speech-in-noise performance in 55- to 65-year-old persons. In addition, the SSQ5 seemed robust in adult populations of different ages (89.6% correlation between the answers of the SSQ5 and SSQ45), as well as in ENT-patient populations (93.7% correlation) and hearing aid candidate populations (79.2% correlation). : The results of this study suggest that disability measures and measures for hearing impairment cannot replace each other, but are complementary. Therefore, it is advised to implement both disability measures and impairment measures in screening and referral policies for hearing loss. To get a first impression of hearing disability, our results suggest that it is useful to ask five disability questions (SSQ5) instead of one general question like ""Do you have hearing loss?""",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=366369614,SFX,22568994 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22568994]

In some breeds, CHSD is associated with a lack of cochlear melanocytes in the stria vascularis, certain coat characteristics, and potentially, abnormalities in neuroepithelial pigment production. This study investigates phenotypic markers for CHSD in 899 Australian Cattle Dogs. Auditory function was tested in 899 Australian Cattle Dogs in family groups using brainstem auditory evoked response testing. Coat colour and patterns, facial and body markings, gender and parental hearing status were recorded.Deafness prevalence among all 899 dogs was 10.8% with 7.5% unilaterally deaf, and 3.3% bilaterally deaf, and amongst pups from completely tested litters (n = 696) was 11.1%, with 7.5% unilaterally deaf, and 3.6% bilaterally deaf.Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed a negative association between deafness and bilateral facial masks (odds ratio 0.2; P <= 0.001). Using multivariable logistic animal modelling, the risk of deafness was lower in dogs with pigmented body spots (odds ratio 0.4; P = 0.050).No significant associations were found between deafness and coat colour.Within unilaterally deaf dogs with unilateral facial masks, no association was observed between the side of deafness and side of mask. The side of unilateral deafness was not significantly clustered amongst unilaterally deaf dogs from the same litter. Females were at increased risk of deafness (odds ratio from a logistic animal model 1.9; P = 0.034) after adjusting for any confounding by mask type and pigmented body spots. Australian Cattle Dogs suffer from CHSD, and this disease is more common in dogs with mask-free faces, and in those without pigmented body patches. In unilaterally deaf dogs with unilateral masks, the lack of observed association between side of deafness and side of mask suggests that if CHSD is due to defects in molecular pigment pathways, the molecular control of embryonic melanoblast migration from ectoderm to skin differs from control of migration from ectoderm to cochlea. In Australian Cattle Dogs, CHSD may be more common in females.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=366394024,SFX,23107143 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23107143]

Little is known about the effectiveness of hearing loss prevention interventions. To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH update to 25 January 2012. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical hearing loss prevention interventions under field conditions among workers exposed to noise. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We included 25 studies. We found no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure but one study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis. Eight studies with 3,430 participants evaluated immediate and long-term effects of personal hearing protection devices (HPDs) and sixteen studies with 82,794 participants evaluated short and long-term effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). The overall quality of studies was low to very low.The one ITS study that evaluated the effect of new legislation in reducing noise exposure found that the median noise level decreased by 27.7 dB(A) (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 dB) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation and that this was associated with a favourable downward trend in time of -2.1 dB per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7).Hearing protection devices attenuated noise with about 20 dB(A) with variation among brands and types but for ear plugs these findings depended almost completely on proper instruction of insertion. Noise attenuation ratings of hearing protection under field conditions were consistently lower than the ratings provided by the manufacturers.One cluster-RCT compared a three-year information campaign as part of a hearing loss prevention programme for agricultural students to audiometry only with three and 16-year follow-up but there were no significant differences in hearing loss. Another study compared a HLPP, which provided regular personal noise exposure information, to a programme without this information in a CBA design. Exposure information was associated with a favourable but non-significant reduction of the rate of hearing loss of -0.82 dB per year (95% CI -1.86 to 0.22). Another cluster-RCT evaluated the effect of extensive on-site training sessions and the use of personal noise-level indicators versus information only on noise levels but did not find a significant difference after four months follow-up (Mean Difference (MD) -0.30 dB(A) (95%CI -3.95 to 3.35).There was very low quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of HPDs as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs. Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect.In four long-term studies, workers in a HLPP still had a 0.5 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than workers that were not exposed to noise (95% CI -0.5 to 1.7) which is about the level of hearing loss caused by exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, two other studies showed substantial risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers. There is low quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Even though case studies show that substantial reductions in noise levels in the workplace can be achieved, there are no controlled studies of the effectiveness of such measures. The effectiveness of hearing protection devices depends on training and their proper use. There is very low quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. Better implementation and reinforcement of HLPPs is needed. Better evaluations of technical interventions and long-term effects are needed.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=366351419,SFX,23076923 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23076923]

Result(s): Cluster analysis was performed among the subjects. Consistent use of hearing aids was the only variable that exhibited a strong relationship with hearing and language skills. Children whose parents were not satisfied exhibited severe hearing loss and limited auditory capacity even with the use of hearing aid, and, consequently, poor auditory skills and speech production.

The mammalian inner ear consists of the auditory and vestibular systems that are each composed of hair cells, supporting cells, neurons, mesenchymal cells, other epithelial cells, and blood vessels. We developed a novel protocol to sort auditory and vestibular tissues of newborn mouse inner ears into their major cellular components. Transcriptome profiling of the sorted cells identified cell type-specific expression clusters. Computational analysis detected transcription factors and microRNAs that play key roles in determining cell identity in the inner ear. Specifically, our analysis revealed the role of the Zeb1/miR-200b pathway in establishing epithelial and mesenchymal identity in the inner ear. Furthermore, we detected a misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway in the inner ear of Twirler mice, which manifest, among other phenotypes, malformations of the auditory and vestibular labyrinth. The association of misregulation of the ZEB1/miR-200b pathway with auditory and vestibular defects in the Twirler mutant mice uncovers a novel mechanism underlying deafness and balance disorders.

This study also informs choices on the selection of tests for clinical evaluation of hearing and listening (e.g., for auditory processing disorder). This is a laboratory-based study of AP threshold and variability of 75 children, aged 6 to 11 yrs, and 21 young adults with normal audiometry recruited from local schools and colleges. Data were gathered in clinic-like conditions, without training and across two sessions. Eleven individual (e.g., simultaneous masking and backward masking [BM], amplitude modulation [AM], and frequency modulation [FM] detection) and three derived (temporal integration, frequency resolution, masking level difference) measure tests were embedded within a suite of computer games, each employing a three-interval, three-alternative (odd-one-out) forced choice response paradigm and a staircase adaptive method. AP measures generally showed lower thresholds and reduced variance with increasing age. At 6 to 7 yrs, performance was markedly poorer than in the older groups; 35% of the children could not do the test of frequency discrimination (FD). However, on all the tasks, some children in the same group performed at near-adult levels. The distribution of performance between individuals varied widely across tasks, with clustered performance on tests of tone detection (with or without a simultaneous masker) and AM detection, and scattered performance on BM, FM detection, and FD. Threshold maturity was achieved at different rates across tests and by 10 to 11 yrs of age on all tests except FD. Masking level difference (MLD) performance did not change with age. Retest reliability was mostly high within test sessions but, again, was poorer for some of the younger children. Between test sessions separated by one to several weeks, reliability varied from poor (for FM detection) to high (for long tone detection in quiet, BM, and FD). Correlations between thresholds on different tests were generally low. Data suggest that the perception of different auditory stimuli occurs and develops using rather independent mechanisms, even for tasks that are closely related in procedure. While individual children can perform reliably on several distinct tasks, differences between individuals on the same tasks can be large. Because some of the youngest children perform reliably across time, at or near adult levels, immaturity between 6 and 11 yrs of age, as reflected in group statistics, reflects poor performance of some individual children rather than obligate, age-related deficits in AP. While several of the tests used were found to have potential clinical applicability, because of their reliability and ability to distinguish between individuals, it is currently unclear how performance on such tests relates to everyday listening skills.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=362345176,SFX,21233712 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21233712]

The economic burden and increasing incidence in younger populations, especially women, reinforces the value of skin cancer prevention. Health education and prior attempts at skin cancer chemoprevention have had limited success. A strong link between epithelial carcinogenesis and elevated polyamines, together with a series of phase I and II trials, led to a NCI-sponsored phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled skin cancer chemoprevention trial of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (500 mg/m2/day) for 4-5 years in 291 subjects with a history of NMSC. Subjects receiving DFMO developed significantly fewer BCC s than placebo subjects with an event rate of 0.28 BCC/person/year versus 0.40 BCC/person/year, (P = 0.03; Total BCCs: DFMO 163, placebo 243). DFMO appeared to have minimal effects on SCC incidence (DFMO 0.15 SCC/person/year, placebo 0.19, p=0.56; Total SCCs: DFMO 95, placebo 115). Subjects tolerated DFMO well, and the only significant observed toxicity was increased audiometric hearing loss. A key issue in the clinical viability of a chemoprevention agent after acute effectiveness and/or tolerance is the latent effectiveness and/or toxicity of the agent. Such effects attributable to DFMO have not been assessed. Earlier chemoprevention research has observed positive and negative latent effects with chemopreventive agents. Use of tamoxifen (5 years) for breast cancer prevention provided continued or greater protection for up to 10 years after drug stoppage. On the contrary, early work with retinoids in oral cancer prevention implied a rebound effect with subjects developing more neoplasms upon discontinuation. Also, the recent linkage between isotretinoin and inflammatory bowel disease is a concerning example of toxicity experienced years after use of a chronically administered agent. The continued interest in DFMO as a chemopreventive agent provided cause to update the clinical data and overall health status of the 291 subjects from the phase III skin cancer prevention study of DFMO to understand the sustainability of the observed DFMO effects. After institutional review board approval, we reviewed medical records of 243 subjects who received care at UW Health. Individual records were manually reviewed, and a pending comparative review of data mining by Natural Language Processing will also be completed. Both reviews focused on the skin cancer events by histology, other neoplasia (invasive and non-invasive), significant other diagnoses, and survival. The rate of skin cancer recurrence from end of study drug to the time of last medical contact (the primary endpoint) was compared between subjects randomized to DFMO or placebo using a two-sample test for primary analysis. As a secondary analysis, the rate of skin cancer recurrence from randomization to the time of last medical contact was also compared. In an exploratory analysis, the primary endpoint was analyzed using Poisson regression models to account for the baseline patient/disease characteristics at the time of randomization such as sex and age of patients and pre-study skin cancer history.

The prevalence of ear diseases was 6.5% of investigated individuals: the standardized rate was 5.9%; 0.2% of investigated individuals had auricle malformation, 2.2% impacted cerumen, 0.2% otitis externa, 0.3% fungi, 0.1% foreign body, 0.1% acute otitis media, 0.9% chronic suppurative otitis media, 1.8% serous otitis media and 1.3% dry perforation of tympanic membrane. Overall, 8.0% of investigated persons were assessed to be likely to benefit from hearing aids, while 4.0% of persons needed medication, 0.1% language/speech rehabilitation, 1.5% non-urgent surgery and 0.9% other treatment. Conclusion(s): The high prevalence of hearing impairment and disability is a heavy burden on social development and also hinders normal family life. The government and society as a whole should show more concern about these problems. Strategies for prevention and intervention should be focused on less developed regions, rural areas, aging people and non-infectious conditions. Hearing aids services, medication, professional education and training are particularly important in developing countries. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&DO=10.3109%2f1651386X.2011.631285,SFX,

This trial assessed whether the intervention resulted in (1) reduced prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) assessed clinically and/or (2) sustained use of hearing protection devices. METHOD(S): In 1992-1996, 34 rural Wisconsin schools were recruited and 17 were assigned randomly to receive a comprehensive, 3-year, hearing conservation intervention. In 2009 -2010, extensive efforts were made to find and contact all students who completed the original trial. Participants in the 16-year follow-up study completed an exposure history questionnaire and a clinical audiometric examination. Rates of NIHL and use of hearing protection were compared. RESULT(S): We recruited 392 participants from the original trial, 200 (53%) from the intervention group and 192 (51%) from the control group. Among participants with exposure to agricultural noise, the intervention group reported significantly greater use of hearing protection compared with the control group (25.9% vs 19.6%; P=.015). The intervention group also reported significantly greater use of hearing protection for shooting guns (56.2% vs 41.6%; P = .029), but the groups reported similar uses of protection in other contexts. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to objective measures of NIHL. CONCLUSION(S): This novel trial provides objective evidence that a comprehensive educational intervention by itself may be of limited effectiveness in preventing NIHL in a young rural population.

We therefore hypothesized that activity in the auditory cortex would be highly variable in children who are deaf. Method(s): To answer this, activity in the deaf brain was evoked by electrical pulses from newly provided bilateral cochlear implants (CIs) in 72 children (n=144 responses). Result(s): Responses were categorized by visual inspection into 3 main types which were validated by principal component cluster analyses; 49% had a negative amplitude wave similar to that previously reported in pre-term infants, 26% were dominated by a positive peak typical of responses in young normal hearing children and experienced paediatric CI users, 25% were novel multi-peaked responses. No significant demographic differences, including duration and onset of deafness, were found between response types. However, children with severe biallelic mutations of GJB-2 showed predominately negative peak type responses (79%) as compared with their peers without these mutations who had a more equal distribution between cortical response types. Conclusion(s): Cortical development in children who are deaf is heterogeneous but can be better predicted when the genotype is known to be a GJB-2 mutation.

Training with a cochlear prosthesis is typically required before speech perception shows improvement, suggesting that relevant experience modifies temporal processing in the central auditory system. We tested this hypothesis in neonatally deafened cats by comparing temporal processing in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of cats that received only chronic passive intracochlear electric stimulation (ICES) with cats that were also trained with ICES to detect temporally challenging trains of electric pulses. After months of chronic passive stimulation and several weeks of detection training in behaviorally trained cats, multineuronal AI responses evoked by temporally modulated ICES were recorded in anesthetized animals. The stimulus repetition rates that produced the maximum number of phase-locked spikes (best repetition rate) and 50% cutoff rate were significantly higher in behaviorally trained cats than the corresponding rates in cats that received only chronic passive ICES. Behavioral training restored neuronal temporal following ability to levels comparable with those recorded in naive prior normal-hearing adult deafened animals. Importantly, best repetitition rates and cutoff rates were highest for neuronal clusters activated by the electrode configuration used in behavioral training. These results suggest that neuroplasticity in the AI is induced by behavioral training and perceptual learning in animals deprived of ordinary auditory experience during development and indicate that behavioral training can ameliorate or restore temporal processing in the AI of profoundly deaf animals. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&DO=10.1152%2fjn.00731.2010,SFX,21543753 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21543753]

The FRAs in middle-aged and old mice were found to be broader and more asymmetric in shape. In addition to a decrease of closed/complex FRAs in both middle age and old groups, there was a transient decrease in V-shaped FRAs and a concomitant increase in multipeak FRAs in middle age. Intensity coding was also affected by age, as observed in an increase of monotonic responses in middle-aged and old mice. While a decline in low-level activity began in middle age, reduced driven rates at suprathreshold levels occurred later in old age. Collectively, these results support the view that aging alters frequency selectivity by widening excitatory FRAs and that these changes begin to appear in middle age. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&DO=10.1016%2fj.neurobiolaging.2009.01.006,SFX,19246123 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19246123]

A different approach is taken in the present study focused on the development of environment-specific noise suppression algorithms. The proposed algorithm selects a subset of the envelope amplitudes for stimulation based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each channel. Binary classifiers, trained using data collected from a particular noisy environment, are first used to classify the mixture envelopes of each channel as either target-dominated (SNR0>=dB) or masker-dominated (SNR<0 dB). Only target-dominated channels are subsequently selected for stimulation. Results with CI listeners indicated substantial improvements (by nearly 44 percentage points at 5 dB SNR) in intelligibility with the proposed algorithm when tested with sentences embedded in three real-world maskers.

We show (a) that phase clustering on the unit circle can separate ALR data from auditory paradigms which require a graduated effort for their solution; (b) the application of TGFs for an inverse artificial phase stabilization at the alpha/theta-border enlarges the endogenously driven listening effort correlates in the reconstructed time- domain waveforms.

We tested and applied a novel probabilistic method called the gamma Model for Oligonucleotide Signals to analyse hybridization signals from Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Expression levels estimated by this method correlated closely (p,0.0001) across a 10-fold range with those measured by quantitative RT-PCR for a sample of 61 different genes. In an unbiased list of 26 genes whose temporal profiles clustered most closely with that of gata3 in all cell lines, 10 were linked to Insulin-like Growth Factor signalling, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB. Knock-down of gata3 in vitro was associated with a decrease in expression of genes linked to IGF-signalling, including IGF1, IGF2 and several IGF-binding proteins. It also led to a small decrease in protein levels of the serine-threonine kinase Akt2/ PKBbeta, a dramatic increase in Akt1/PKBalpha protein and relocation of Akt1/PKBalpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, a known target of PKB/Akt, simultaneously decreased. In heterozygous gata3 null mice the expression of gata3 correlated with high levels of activated Akt/PKB. This functional relationship could explain the diverse function of gata3 during development, the hearing loss associated with gata3 heterozygous null mice and the broader symptoms of human patients with Hearing-Deafness-Renal anomaly syndrome. © 2009 Milo et al.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0007144,SFX,19774072 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19774072]

We neonatally deafened 17 cats before the onset of hearing, thereby abolishing virtually all afferent input from the auditory periphery. In seven animals the auditory pathway was chronically reactivated with environmentally derived electrical stimuli presented via a multichannel intracochlear electrode array implanted at 8 weeks of age. Electrical stimulation was provided by a clinical cochlear implant that was used continuously for periods of up to 7 months. In 10 long-term deafened cats and three age-matched normal-hearing controls, an intracochlear electrode array was implanted immediately prior to cortical recording. We recorded from a total of 812 single unit and multiunit clusters in AI of all cats as adults using a combination of single tungsten and multichannel silicon electrode arrays. The absence of afferent activity in the long-term deafened animals had little effect on the basic response properties of AI neurons but resulted in complete loss of the normal cochleotopic organization of AI. This effect was almost completely reversed by chronic reactivation of the auditory pathway via the cochlear implant. We hypothesize that maintenance or reestablishment of a cochleotopically organized AI by activation of a restricted sector of the cochlea, as demonstrated in the present study, contributes to the remarkable clinical performance observed among human patients implanted at a young age. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&DO=10.1002%2fcne.21886,SFX,18972570 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18972570]

In an earlier study, we used Ly5.1 congenic mice as transplant recipients to investigate the role of hematopoietic stem cells in the adult mouse inner ear. An unanticipated finding was that a large percentage of the SGNs in this strain were unmyelinated. Further characterization of the auditory phenotype of young adult Ly5.1 mice in the present study revealed several unusual characteristics, including 1) large aggregates of unmyelinated SGNs in the apical and middle turns, 2) symmetrical junction-like contacts between the unmyelinated neurons, 3) abnormal expression patterns for CNPase and connexin 29 in the SGN clusters, 4) reduced SGN density in the basal cochlea without a corresponding loss of sensory hair cells, 5) significantly delayed auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I latencies at low and middle frequencies compared with control mice with similar ABR threshold, and 6) elevated ABR thresholds and deceased wave I amplitudes at high frequencies. Taken together, these data suggest a defect in Schwann cells that leads to incomplete myelinization of SGNs during cochlear development. The Ly5.1 mouse strain appears to be the only rodent model so far identified with a high degree of the ""human-like"" feature of unmyelinated SGNs that aggregate into neural clusters. Thus, this strain may provide a suitable animal platform for modeling human auditory information processing such as synchronous neural activity and other auditory response properties. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&DO=10.1002%2fcne.22398,SFX,20575058 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20575058]

The two specific aims for this research were (1) to describe the audiometric and clinical characteristics of children identified with slight-mild bilateral SNHL and (2) to compare children with slight-mild SNHL with those with normal hearing (NH) with respect to potential risk factors for congenital or acquired for hearing loss. DESIGN: A cross-sectional cluster sample survey of 6581 children enrolled in years 1 and 5 of Australian elementary school was completed. Children were screened for slight-mild SNHL, defined as a low- and/or high-frequency pure-tone average of 16 to 40 dB HL in the better ear, with air-bone gaps <10 dB. Children who did not pass the screen received air and bone conduction threshold and tympanometry tests to determine the type and degree of hearing loss. The parents of every child who participated in this study completed a questionnaire, before the hearing screening, to ascertain possible risk indicators. The questionnaire included items regarding the family's demographics, hearing status of family members, the presence of risk factors, and parental concern regarding the child's hearing. RESULT(S): Fifty-five children with slight-mild SNHL and 5490 with NH were identified. Of the group with SNHL, 39 children had a slight loss (16 to 25 dB HL) and 16 had a mild loss (26 to 40 dB HL). The majority of the losses were bilateral and symmetrical, and the mean pure-tone average for the better ear for all 55 children was 22.4 dB HL (SD, 5.2). The most prevalent risk factor was ""neonatal intensive care unit/special care nursery admission,"" which was reported for 12.5% of the SNHL and 8.4% of the NH group. Reported use of personal stereos was a significant risk factor with an odds ratio of 1.7 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 3.0, p = 0.05). The questions relating to parental concern for their child's hearing had low sensitivity (<30%) and very low positive predictive values (<3%) for detecting slight-mild SNHL. CONCLUSION(S): Slight-mild SNHL had a prevalence of 0.88% among the school-aged population sampled, with the majority of these children exhibiting bilateral, symmetrical audiometric configurations. Conventional risk factors for hearing loss were not strongly predictive of slight-mild SNHL nor were parental concerns about the child's hearing ability. The association between slight-mild SNHL and the parent report of personal stereo use suggests that this type of noise exposure may be a risk factor for acquired hearing loss. This seems to be the first documentation of such an association in a large sample of young children.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=358939630,SFX,20054279 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20054279]

Previous research attempts to quantify the degree of neural synchrony at higher levels of the central auditory system have indicated that synchronized firing of neurons during presentation of an acoustic stimulus could play an important role in coding complex sound features. However, it is unknown whether this synchrony could in fact arise from the VCN as it is the first station in the central auditory pathway. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted on 499 pairs of multiunit clusters recorded in the urethane-anesthetized rat VCN in response to pure tones and combinations of two tones to determine the presence of neural synchrony. The shift predictor correlogram was used as a measure for determining the synchrony owing to the effects of the stimulus. Without subtraction of the shift predictor, over 65% of the pairs of multiunit clusters exhibited significant correlation in neural firing when the frequencies of the tones presented matched their characteristic frequencies (CFs). In addition, this stimulus-evoked neural synchrony was dependent on the physical distance between electrode sites, and the CF difference between multiunit clusters as the number of correlated pairs dropped significantly for electrode sites greater than 800 vm apart and for multiunit cluster pairs with a CF difference greater than 0.5 octaves. However, subtraction of the shift predictor correlograms from the raw correlograms resulted in no remaining correlation between all VCN pairs. These results suggest that while neural synchrony may be a feature of sound coding in the VCN, it is stimulus induced and not due to intrinsic neural interactions within the nucleus. These data provide important implications for stimulation strategies for the auditory brainstem implant, which is used to provide functional hearing to the profoundly deaf through electrical stimulation of the VCN. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&DO=10.1088%2f1741-2560%2f6%2f6%2f065003,SFX,19850978 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19850978]

Several isoforms of class II myosins are required for cytokinesis, cell motility, cell polarity/chemotaxis, cell architecture, and development of nonmuscle cells. Among these, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC-IIA) encoded by MYH9, is known to be associated with inherited human disease, MYH9 disorders, characterized by giant platelets, thrombocytopenia and characteristic Dohle body-like cytoplasmic granulocyte inclusion bodies. Also, these disorders frequently present with nephritis and sensorineural hearing disability. Particularly, recent studies using admixture mapping identified MYH9 as a major risk factor for focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) and nondiabetic kidney disease in African Americans. However, the function of NMMHCII-A, in the affected variable organs and how the gene is related to the disease have not been elucidated. In turn, our previous studies have shown that the MTH9+/- mice do not reproduce the clinical picture of MYH9 disorders and the MYH9-/- mice are lethal early during embryogenesis. Several MYH9 mutations are in most patients missense mutations occurring at a few codons and it is still ambiguous whether mutations determine haploinsufficiency or act through a dominant negative mechanism. We and other investigators indicated that human subjects with mutations in the motor domain, particularly at Arg 702 presented with severe thrombocytopenia and develop nephritis and deafness before the age of 40 years. Here we generate and characterize mice expressing Arg702Cys (R702C) mutation. To introduce the mutation into exon 16 of MYH9 gene, a loxP-flanked PGK-neo selectable marker cassette was inserted into the intron upstream of exon 16, according with negative DT marker. Chimeric mice generated from two independent targeted 129SvJ ES cell clones were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to produce R702C heterozygotes. The loxP-neo cassette was removed by crossing the heterozygous mice with a CAG-Cre deleter mouse strain that constitutively expresses Cre recombinase to yield heterozygous knock in mice (R702C+/-). R702C+/- mice had markedly decreased platelet counts (53+/-31x109/L vs 1071.+/-321.7x109/L) and morphologically larger platelets than wild-type C57/BL6 mice. Although granulocyte inclusion bodies were mostly invisible or inconspicuous on May-Giemsa stained blood smears, immunofluorecence analysis indicated NMMHC-IIA proteins aggregated and accumulated in the granulocyte cytoplasm. Although the number of bone marrow megakaryocytes was comparable to wild-type mice, proplatelet formation of fetal liver-derived megakaryocytes from R702C+/- was impaired; the number of proplatelet-forming megakaryocytes was decreased and clusters of platelet-like particles were observed around megakaryocytes. The increased size and decreased number of proplatelet tips were also detected. To verify kidney function, spot urine samples free of fecal contamination were collected during 5-20 weeks (w) after birth. R702C+/- mice displayed a significant proteinuria dependent on age, whereas wild type mice had only trace amount (Figure). Examination of renal pathology of R702C+/- mice of 20w after birth revealed typical FSGS by light microscopy and podocyte foot process effacement by electron microscopy. Apparently, altered podocyte morphology at the foot process level resulted in a partial loss of glomerular filtration barrier. (Figure presented) We further measured the auditory brainstem response (ABR) of 20w R702C+/- mice and studied whether they had hearing losses, Needle electrodes were inserted into the vertex of anesthetized mice, then ABR was obtained. The ABR thresholds in R702C+/- mice were significantly higher at all frequencies, indicating severe deafness. Our observations suggested that heterozygous expression of MYH9 R702C affected not only megakaryocyte proplatelet formation apparently resulting in macrothrombocytopenia, but also the function of the cells in other affected organs, where NMMHC-IIA is known to be exclusively expressed.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=70776459,SFX,

Yip. L.",,"(Fathman, Kodama, Creusot, Yip.) Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States",Elsevier,"Introduction: A strong association with the MHC has been reported for all autoimmune diseases studied to date [1]. For many years a leading hypothesis for this association between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and autoimmune disease is that disease-associated MHC alleles bind autoantigens and present them to autoreactive T lymphocytes [2]. However, a major anomaly for any proposed relationship between MHC and autoimmune disease is the concordance rate for autoimmune diseases seen among monozygotic siblings, frequently below 50%, suggesting that epigenetic and environmental factors influence disease [3]. Studies to be reported will examine the hypothesis that genes encoded as antigen-presenting molecules in the MHC allow initial ""autoantigen"" recognition, however subsequent progression to autoimmunity is due to stochastic events driven by inflammation. Results to be presented will examine the following hypothesis: exposure to a common environmental antigen (or antigens) can be recognized by genetically at risk individuals expressing disease associated MHC molecules in either a disease-provoking manner (recognition and presentation of a disease-provoking antigenic epitope), or conversely, by recognition and presentation of a non-disease-provoking epitope (simply put, bad luck versus good luck). This hypothesis would allow an autoimmune disease concordance rate of 50% for monozygotic twins encountering a single environmental antigen that expresses two equally dominant epitopes, only one of which is disease provoking. The larger the number of non-disease-provoking antigenic epitopes recognized on the inductive antigen(s), the less disease concordance, the more immunodominant the disease-provoking epitope, the greater the rate of disease concordance. This hypothesis was examined in an animal model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, through the use of MHC congenic mice, where imposition of the ""non-permissive"" H-2b haplotype onto NOD mice eficiently silences the NOD autoimmune disease. In this hypothesis, NOD.B10 mice serve as surrogate to the good luck twin because, while they do not present the disease provoking epitope of the causative antigen in a disease inductive fashion, the mice are otherwise isogenic. By only allowing the disease related I-Ag7 MHC bearing NOD mice to recognize a disease provoking antigenic epitope, changes in gene expression seen when comparing multiple tissues at multiple time points in these otherwise isogenic mice should allow identification of the genes whose expression is changed by disease pathophysiology. Any changes in gene expression in this experimental system would result from epigenetic events, not polymorphisms or mutations in the genes. Experimental Plan: NOD mice develop T1D, whereas congenic NOD.B10 mice, differing only at the MHC complex, do not develop any signs of disease. Using Agilent whole genome microarrays, gene expression changes in multiple tissues [pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), spleen (SPL), and peripheral blood cells (PBC)] from individual female NOD mice (n < 8) were compared over time (10 days, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks of age) to tissue matched pooled NOD.B10 controls, to identify changes in gene expression over time or within selected tissues that are correlated with disease progression [4]. These studies demonstrated several changes in gene expression that were both age-dependent and tissue-speciic: an early stage (10 days to 4 weeks), seen only in the PLN and PBC, corresponding to immune inductive events, as well as a later stage seen between 12-20 weeks in the PLN, SPL and PBC that correlates with beta cell destructive events. Changes in gene expression (either the result of splice variants or changes in transcript level) were seen among genes within previously demarcated Idd regions leading to potential candidate Idd gene identiication. Using hierarchical clustering to identify genes whose expression changed in a similar manner, many genes showing uniform patterns of changes in expression over time were seen in these tissues, but the genes whose expression changed, and/or the kinetics of change were unique to each tissue. These studies identiied tissue and age-speciic gene expression patterns that seem to play an important role in the initiation or onset of T1D. As an example, microarray analysis, subsequent QPCR, and use of a knock out mouse, allowed us to demonstrate that the transcriptional regulator Deaf1 controls the expression of -600 genes including various peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs) in the pancreatic lymph node (PLN) [5]. In the NOD mouse model of T1D, we cloned and characterized a truncated alternatively spliced variant of Deaf1, Deaf1-VAR1. This isoform lacks the nuclear localization signal, and accordingly, is expressed in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Deaf1-VAR1 is non-functional and acts in a dominant negative manner by interfering with the transcriptional activity of canonical Deaf1 by hetero-dimerizing with it and retaining it in the cytoplasm. We found that the expression of Deaf1 correlated with the expression of pancreatic PTAs including insulin. Coincident with the onset of destructive insulitis in NOD mice, Deaf1 expression is downregulated in the PLN, while the expression of Deaf1-VAR1 is upregulated, compared to its expression in non-diabetic NOD.B10 mice. Remarkably, an equivalent alternatively spliced Deaf1 isoform was identiied in the PLN of T1D patients. This human variant behaves like the mouse Deaf1-VAR1, and was -20-fold more abundant in the PLN of T1D patients than controls. The high expression of this variant also correlated with the absence of insulin gene expression in the PLN of T1D patients. Discussion(s): These indings suggest that a reduction in Deaf1-controlled PTA expression in the PLN could lead to decreased peripheral tolerance and might help explain the pathogenesis of NOD disease and human T1D. We propose that during the progression of NOD disease, alternative splicing of Deaf1 occurs in the PLN, leading to increased Deaf1-VAR1 and decreased Deaf1 levels. Deaf1-VAR1 acts as a dominant negative for transcriptional activity of Deaf1, and therefore, blocks the expression of PTAs in the PLN. Decreased expression of pancreatic antigens in the PLN may reduce peripheral tolerance and lead to the survival of autoreactive T cells that recognize these antigens. Thus, we suggest that a dysregulation in Deaf1 isoform expression in NOD mice can contribute to the development of diabetes and potentially other autoimmune diseases.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&DO=10.1016%2fS1873-9954%252810%252970009-4,SFX,

However, their expression within the inner ear is still largely undefined. In this study, we explored the possibility that specific CD proteins might be useful for defining inner ear cell populations. mRNA expression profiling of microdissected auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia revealed 107 CD genes as expressed in the early postnatal mouse inner ear. The expression of 68 CD genes was validated with real-time RT-PCR using RNA extracted from microdissected sensory epithelia of cochleae, utricles, saccules, and cristae of newborn mice. Specifically, CD44 was identified as preferentially expressed in the auditory sensory epithelium. Immunohistochemistry revealed that within the early postnatal organ of Corti, the expression of CD44 is restricted to outer pillar cells. In order to confirm and expand this finding, we characterized the expression of CD44 in two different strains of mice with loss- and gain-of-function mutations in Fgfr3 which encodes a receptor for FGF8 that is essential for pillar cell development. We found that the expression of CD44 is abolished from the immature pillar cells in homozygous Fgfr3 knockout mice. In contrast, both the outer pillar cells and the aberrant Deiters' cells in the Fgfr3P24RR/+ mice express CD44. The deafness phenotype segregating in DFNB51 families maps to a linkage interval that includes CD44. To study the potential role of CD44 in hearing, we characterized the auditory system of CD44 knockout mice and sequenced the entire open reading frame of CD44 of affected members of DFNB51 families. Our results suggest that CD44 does not underlie the deafness phenotype of the DFNB51 families.

Method(s): We analyzed a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial, with schools as the unit of randomization. Thirty-four rural schools were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. The intervention included classroom instruction, distribution of hearing protection devices, direct mailings, noise level assessments, and yearly audiometric testing. The control group received the audiometric testing. Result(s): Students exposed to the hearing conservation program reported more frequent use of hearing protection devices, but there was no evidence of reduced levels of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Conclusion(s): Our analysis suggests that, since NIHL is cumulative, a 3-year study was likely not long enough to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention.

Aquaporins, particularly aquaporin 4 (Aqp4), are membrane proteins with important roles in water and ion flux across cell membranes, including cells of the inner ear and pathways of the brain used for hearing. To more fully understand the biological bases of presbycusis, 39 CBA mice, a well-studied animal model of presbycusis, underwent non-invasive hearing testing as a function of sound frequency (auditory brainstem response - ABR thresholds, and distortion-product otoacoustic emission - DPOAE magnitudes), and were clustered into four groups based on age and hearing ability. Aqp4 gene expression, as determined by genechip microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, was compared to the young adult control group in the three older groups: middle aged with good hearing, old age with mild presbycusis, and old age with severe presbycusis. Linear regression and ANOVA showed statistically significant changes in Aqp4 gene expression and ABR and DPOAE hearing status in the cochlea and auditory midbrain - inferior colliculus. Down-regulation in the cochlea was seen, and an initial down-, then up-regulation was discovered for the inferior colliculus Aqp4 expression. It is theorized that these changes in Aqp4 gene expression represent an age-related disruption of ion flux in the fluids of the cochlea that are responsible for ionic gradients underlying sound transduction in cochlear hair cells necessary for hearing. In regard to central auditory processing at the level of the auditory midbrain, aquaporin gene expression changes may affect neurotransmitter cycling involving supporting cells, thus impairing complex sound neural processing with age. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Neurodiagnostic methods for an objective listening effort estimation could revolutionize auditory rehabilitation. However the cognitive neurodynamics of listening effort is not understood and research related its neural correlates is still in its infancy. In this paper we present a phase clustering analysis of large-scale listening effort correlates in auditory late responses (ALRs). For this we apply the complex wavelet transform as well as tight Gabor Frame (TGF) operators. We show (a) that phase clustering on the unit circle can separate ALR data from auditory paradigms which require a graduated effort for their solution; (b) the application of TGFs for an inverse artificial phase stabilization at the alpha/theta-border enlarges the endogenously driven listening effort correlates in the reconstructed time- domain waveforms. It is concluded that listening effort correlates can be extracted from ALR sequences using an instantaneous phase clustering analysis, at least by means of the applied experimental pure tone paradigm.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=355918750,SFX,19964575 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19964575]

We ascertained a consanguineous Iranian family segregating with autosomal-recessive bilateral microtia, mixed symmetrical severe to profound hearing impairment, and partial cleft palate. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the responsible gene to chromosome 7p14.3-p15.3 with a maximum multi-point LOD score of 4.17. In this region, homeobox genes from the HOXA cluster were the most interesting candidates. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of the HOXA1 and HOXA2 homeobox genes from the candidate region identified an interesting HOXA2 homeodomain variant: a change in a highly conserved amino acid (p.Q186K). The variant was not found in 231 Iranian and 109 Belgian control samples. The critical contribution of HoxA2 for auditory-system development has already been shown in mouse models. We built a homology model to predict the effect of this mutation on the structure and DNA-binding activity of the homeodomain by using the program Modeler 8v2. In the model of the mutant homeodomain, the position of the mutant lysine side chain is consistently farther away from a nearby phosphate group; this altered position results in the loss of a hydrogen bond and affects the DNA-binding activity. © 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed10&DO=10.1016%2fj.ajhg.2008.02.015,SFX,18394579 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18394579]

METHOD(S): In 2003, a cross-sectional household survey was conducted of 2,427 persons 4 years old and over. The study population was composed of 1,040 systematically chosen households in 40 randomly selected census tracts (dwelling clusters) in the city of Canoas, which is in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil. Hearing function was evaluated in all subjects by both pure-tone audiometry and physical examination, using the World Health Organization Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and definitions of hearing levels. The socioeconomic data that were gathered included the amount of schooling of all individuals tested and the income of the head of the household. RESULT(S): It was found that 26.1% of the population studied showed some level of hearing impairment, and 6.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.5%-8.1%) were classified in the disabling hearing impairment group. The prevalence of moderate hearing loss was 5.4% (95% CI = 4.4%-6.4%); for severe hearing loss, 1.2% (95% CI = 0.7%-1.7%); and for profound hearing loss, 0.2% (95% CI = 0.03%-0.33%). The groups at higher risk for hearing loss were men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.06-2.23); participants 60 years of age and over (OR = 12.55; 95% CI = 8.38-18.79); those with fewer years of formal schooling (OR = 3.92; 95% CI = 2.14-7.16); and those with lower income (OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.06-2.27).

The CI induces an artifact in the recording at the electrodes in the temporal lobe area (where it is implanted) when specific tones are presented, this artifact in particular makes the detection and analysis of AEPs much more challenging. This paper evaluates the convenience of using Blind Source Separation (BSS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in order to identify the AEPs from ongoing recordings and to isolate the artifact when testing a child with a CI. We propose a new procedure to elicit an objective differentiation between the independent components (ICs) related to the AEPs and CI artifact; two concepts are fundamental in this procedure Mutual Information (MI) and Clustering. Finally, the variability of three BSS/ICA algorithms is assessed; in order to determine which one is more convenient to isolate the respective ICs of interest.

In this study, we used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to determine whether the heightened excitability of the ACx following neonatal sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) also involves pre- or postsynaptic alterations of GABAergic synapses. SNHL was induced in gerbils just prior to the onset of hearing (postnatal day 10). At P17, the gamma-aminobutyri acid type A (GABAA) receptor's beta2/3-subunit (GABAAbeta2/3) clusters residing at plasma membranes in layers 2/3 of ACx was reduced significantly in size (P < 0.05) and number (P < 0.005), whereas the overall number of immunoreactive puncta (intracellular + plasmalemmal) remained unchanged. The reduction of GABA Abeta2/3 was observed along perikaryal plasma membranes of excitatory neurons but not of GABAergic interneurons. This cell-specific change can contribute to the enhanced excitability of SNHL ACx. Presynaptically, GABAergic axon terminals were significantly larger but less numerous and contained 47% greater density of glutamic acid decarboxylase immunoreactivity (P < 0.05). This suggests that GABA synthesis may be upregulated by a retrograde signal arising from lowered levels of postsynaptic GABAAR. Thus, both, the pre- and postsynaptic sides of inhibitory synapses that form upon pyramidal neurons of the ACx are regulated by neonatal auditory experience. © The Author 2008.

Research Design: This was a cross-sectional population-based study. Study Sample: Estimates generalizing to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States were based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected from 2819 women and 2525 men between 1999 and 2004. Estimates from the rural county were based on Keokuk County Rural Health Study (KCRHS) data collected from 892 women and 750 men between 1994 and 1998. Data Collection and Analysis: Cluster analyses (k-means) were used to divide participants into groups including maximally similar bilateral air conduction audiograms. Separate cluster analyses were conducted for each gender. For NHANES data, prevalence and error estimates were obtained using sample weights intended to provide data generalizing to the noninstitutionalized population of the United States within this age range. Result(s): The hierarchical structure of audiometric configurations revealed that approximately 25% of women and 50% of men aged 20 to 69 in the noninstitutionalized population of the United States were best described by a configuration consistent with a marked hearing impairment in at least one frequency. Hearing impairments were more common among participants in the KCRHS. Gently sloping configurations of hearing impairment were dominant among women, while configurations featuring a greater slope were dominant among men. There was a greater variety of audiometric configurations in men than women.

To address this challenge, we have developed a machine learning-based software tool, AudioGene v2.0, to prioritize candidate genes for mutation screening based on audioprofiling. Method(s): We analyzed audiometric data from a cohort of American families with high-frequency autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. Those families predicted to have a DFNA2 audioprofile by AudioGene v2.0 were screened for mutations in the KCNQ4 gene. Result(s): Two novel missense mutations and a stop mutation were detected in three American families predicted to have DFNA2-related deafness for a positive predictive value of 6.3%. The false negative rate was 0%. The missense mutations were located in the channel pore region and the stop mutation was in transmembrane domain S5. The latter is the first DFNA2-causing stop mutation reported in KCNQ4.

For the current study, it was hypothesized that auditory feedback maintains the speech motor control mechanisms that are constraining acoustic variability of F3 in /r/; thus the listener's percept remains /r/ despite the range of articulatory configurations employed by the speaker. Given the potential importance of auditory feedback, postlingually deafened speakers should show larger acoustic variation in /r/ allophones than hearing controls, and auditory feedback from a cochlear implant could reduce that variation over time. To test these hypotheses, measures were made of phoneme perception and of production of tokens containing /r/, stop consonants, and /r/+stop clusters in hearing controls and in eight postlingually deafened adults pre- and postimplant. Postimplant, seven of the eight implant speakers did not differ from the control mean. It was also found that implant users' production of stop and stop+/r/ blend improved with time but the measured acoustic contrast between these was still better in the control speakers than for the implant group even after the implant users had experienced a year of improved auditory feedback. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed10&DO=10.1121%2f1.2987427,SFX,19045803 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19045803]

FISH mapping refined the breakpoints to 2q31.1 and 17q24.3-25.1 and showed the 2q31.1 breakpoint likely affects the HOXD gene cluster. Several atypical findings and lack of an identifiable TCOF1 mutation suggest that this child has a provisionally unique mandibulofacial dysostosis syndrome. The apparently balanced de novo translocation provides candidate loci for atypical and TCOF1 mutation negative cases of TCS.

The frequency-tuning curve bandwidth at 20 dB above threshold was significantly increased compared to controls in the CF region of the hearing loss.

The vectorstrength in noise-exposed cats increased for all modulation frequencies below 32 Hz for neurons with a CF in the range of the hearing loss. The tMTFs for AMnoise in the noise-exposed group were less band-pass compared to the controls, and in that sense the mild hearing loss could be considered as effectively reducing the central activation in the same way as a reduced sound pressure level.

The aim of this study is to explore the viability of cochlear implantation in children with CHARGE syndrome and to assess the outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHOD(S): Eleven children presenting with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss associated with CHARGE syndrome were the subjects of this study. Routine audiometric measurements and the Infant Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) were performed pre- and postoperatively. In addition, the degree of the subjects' cochlear deformity were measured and correlated to outcome. RESULT(S): All patients had varying degrees of ear anomalies, seven patients suffered from coloboma of the eyes, two had heart defects, five exhibited choanal atresia, eleven showed developmental retardation, and six had genitourinary abnormalities. Ten of the children underwent cochlear implantation with complete insertion of the electrode array without complication and were followed over a 3-month to a 7-year period. The eleventh child was not implanted because of severe retardation. All of the implanted children showed varying, but limited degrees, of auditory benefit as measured by routine audiometry and the IT-MAIS. CONCLUSION(S): Careful treatment planning for children with sensorineural hearing loss and CHARGE syndrome can lead to varying, but limited degrees, of auditory benefit with no increase in surgical complications.

The CI induces an artifact in the recording at the electrodes in the temporal lobe area (where it is implanted) when specific tones are presented, this artifact in particular makes the detection and analysis of AEPs much more challenging. This paper evaluates the convenience of using Blind Source Separation (BSS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in order to identify the AEPs from ongoing recordings and to isolate the artifact when testing a child with a CI. We propose a new procedure to elicit an objective differentiation between the independent components (ICs) related to the AEPs and CI artifact; two concepts are fundamental in this procedure Mutual Information (MI) and Clustering. Finally, the variability of three BSS/ICA algorithms is assessed; in order to determine which one is more convenient to isolate the respective ICs of interest.

We developed and validated a diagnostic model using a generalisation of neural networks, for detecting vestibular schwannomas from clinical and audiological data, and compared its performance with six previously published clinical and audiological decision-support screening protocols. Design(s): Probabilistic complex data classification using a neural network generalization. Setting(s): Tertiary referral lateral skull base and a computational neuroscience unit. Participant(s): Clinical and audiometric details of 129 patients with, and as many age and sex-matched patients without vestibular schwannomas, as determined with magnetic resonance imaging. Main Outcome Measure(s): The ability to diagnose a patient as having or not having vestibular schwannoma. Result(s): A Gaussian Process Ordinal Regression Classifier was trained and cross-validated to classify cases as 'with' or 'without' vestibular schwannoma, and its diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operator characteristic plots. It proved possible to pre-select sensitivity and specificity, with an area under the curve of 0.8025. At 95% sensitivity, the trained system had a specificity of 56%, 30% better than audiological protocols with closest sensitivities. The sensitivities of previously-published audiological protocols ranged between 82-97%, and their specificities ranged between 15-61%. Discussion(s): The Gaussian Process ORdinal Regression Classifier increased the flexibility and specificity of the screening process for vestibular schwannoma when applied to a sample of matched patients with and without this condition. If applied prospectively, it could reduce the number of 'normal' magnetic resonance (MR) scans by as much as 30% without reducing detection sensitivity.

Although it is a communication system different to babbling and language, it is related with the future development of phonation. Cry analysis provides information about the neurophysiologic and psychological states of newborns and the identification of perinatal abnormalities. It is necessary to discuss the subject extensively because there are new data on situations such as laringomalacia, congenital hypothyroidism, deafness and sleep apnea that seem to be associated to infantile crying behaviors. Infant cries can be analyzed as behavioral conditions (hunger, anger and pain cries) allows knowing of mother-child relationship or the effect under diverse cultural conditions, such as stress, emotional deprivation or illness. A spectrographic analysis of the cries may identify several characteristics: threshold, latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum of the fundamental frequency (F0), occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, gliding, melody, biphonation, bifurcation, noise concentration, quality of the voice, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibratos, melody types, F0 stability and inspiratory stridor. To date, it has not been possible to establish alteration patterns. The best studied variables are F0, its harmonics and the duration of each emission; it is accepted that F0 varies between 400 and 600 Hz, during 1.4 +/- 0.6 s. Under such approaches, diverse alterations and risk factors have been studied: congenital alterations, malnutrition, sudden death, maternal exposition to drugs, prematurely born babies or perinatal asphyxia and disturbances of the central nervous system. Authors have reported F0 equal or less than 300 Hz in cases of sudden death or with high frequencies, near the 1000 Hz in the Cri du chat syndrome, perinatal asphyxia and other cases who died suddenly. During the cry, there is an increase of intra-abdominal pressure, heart rate and blood pressure, reduction of oxygen saturation, increase of the intra cranial-pressure, beginning of stress reactions, depletion of the energy anf oxygen reserves, such as the found in the Valsalva's maneuver. Every event of prolonged cries implies alteration of the breathing control like a Hering-Breuer reflex. Considering that some authors have proposed early vocalizations are a good predictor of deafness, in a previous paper we reported the characteristics of the cry of 20 deaf neonates. However, we were not able to demonstrate differences when comparing them with normal hearing neonates and infants, using only parametric methods. Still, we decided to go further and investigate the quality of infant cries of deaf neonates and infants. Material and methods. Twenty zero-to two-year old cases were studied; they were deaf children of both sexes; all cases were included in a follow-up program on the Human Communication Department of the National Institute of Perinatology of Mexico and were compared with 20 normal hearing children. We recorded Brain Stem Evoked Auditory Responses (BEAR) and cry recording using a digital Sony recorder during the physical exploration. We analyzed the frequency (Hz) and duration of the espiratory cries, the duration of inspiration between two cry emissions and the characteristics of the spectrogram. Quantitative analysis. The usual estimates of means and standard variation were obtained and they were compared with one way analysis of variance. We organized typologies of frequency by means of cluster techniques (Ward method). The distribution of the duration of the periods of crying and silence was explored with a contingency tables. Qualitative analysis. Two standardized observers visually analyzed all the cries to determine any variation of F0 and of harmonic frequencies. Whenever a variation of F0 was observed, we obtained maximum and minimum frequencies, as well as average duration of each cry emission. The procedure was validated by means of the graphic comparison with a Fourier's analysis. Results. Mean duration of cries in the deaf group was 0.5845 +/- 0.6150 s (range 0.08-5.2 s), while in the group of normal hearing cases was 0.5387 +/- 0.2631 (range 0.06-1.75 s). From the deaf group, five cases had very prolonged duration of cries, without statistical significance. The mean duration of the inspiration was 0.3962 +/- 0.2326, with a range of 0.06 to 1.75 in the deaf group and of 0.4083 +/- 0.1854, with a range of 0.21 at 0.96, in the controls, without difference among groups. There was no correlation between the time of espiratory cry and that of the inspiration. Three cry topologies were organized: one of shorter duration (mean 0.30 s), with 111 spectrograms, an intermediate one (mean 0.73) with 85 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 4.5 s) with spectrograms of three cases. Three topologies of the inspiratory period were obtained: one of short periods (mean 0.33 s), with 171 spectrograms, one of intermediate duration (mean 0.80 s) with 18 spectrograms and one of prolonged duration (mean 1.60 s) with three cases. There were no statistical differences of tipologies between the deaf groups and normal hearing cases. On the qualitative analysis of cries, we came across several variations which are interpreted as abnormalities: vibratos, poor melodic control, loss of fundamental frequencies, harmonic limited production, plosives, gliding, bi phonation, and a loss of intensity at end of cry emissions. These changes were also observed on the control cases, but only in a very limited number. Discussion. Cry spectrogram analysis are non invasive indicators of the neonate's neurophysiologic organization. Although cry duration varies in healthy newborns, the accepted variation for a normal range is 1.1 to 2.8 s, with standard deviations around 0.6 s. Consistent differences have not been demonstrated between risk and control groups. However, abnormal cases such as Down syndrome or severe asphyxia have very short cries, whereas on the Cri du chat syndrome the duration of cries is prolonged. Extended cries imply cardiac and respiratory risks which have been associated with later outcomes as development retardation and sudden death. There are also some questions to solve, such as the regulation and control of cry, starting from breathing mechanisms or from a sensorial afferent, mediated by hearing. The deaf infants are constituted in a study model, considering that the auditory afference is suppressed and the control of the cry is restricted to the breathing environment. In the studied spectrograms, the duration of the cry was within reported normal limits by other authors, inasmuch in the normal hearing control cases as in the deaf, except the dissident cases, but without these reaching statistical significance. Further research of brainstem function is needed for the abnormal cases with prolonged cry periods, since such cries are interpreted as an alteration of the breathing reflexes of Hering-Breuer, which might have a pathological meaning in the sense of the sob's spasm or even more severe risk factors as sleep apnea and even sudden death. The qualitative analysis in the deaf individuals demonstrated a poor quality and unstable character of melodic control, with a smaller number of harmonics. The deaf cases lost the relationship between the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics, mainly because of the participation of supraglottic structures that modulate pitch and due to the poorness of melodic control, either for monotony or due to the impossibility of returning to a normal pattern, following variations such as vibrato, plosives or noise concentration. In the cases of prolonged cries, starting from the third second, the sound intensity tends to diminish and the harmonics are lost, perhaps due to a decrease of the subglottal pressure of phonation. This finding supports the auditory control of crying related to breathing mechanisms. Conclusions. In preliminary terms, by means of the melodic analysis of the spectrograms, differences are demonstrated between the cries of the deaf and of the normal hearing cases. The increase of the complexity of the melody of the cry, or their poverty, are indicative of the neuromuscular function and they may support the evaluation of phonation before language development. The study of the spectrograms of deaf individuals does not constitute an element for the detection or for diagnosis since, to date, estimators of sensibility or of specificity have not been established, but they constitute a support for its integral evaluation, with the possibility of evaluating and of improving therapeutic rehabilitation.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=46209984,SFX,

This study estimated the prevalence of CSD in Border Collies and investigated its association with phenotypic attributes linked to the merle gene, including coat pigmentation and iris color. Hypothesis: Deafness in Border Collies is associated with pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene. Animals: A total of 2597 Border Collies from the United Kingdom. Method(s): A retrospective study of Border Collies tested, during 1994-2002, by using brainstem auditory evoked responses. Associations between deafness and phenotypic attributes were assessed by using generalized logistic regression. Result(s): The prevalence of CSD in puppies was estimated as 2.8%. The corresponding rates of unilateral and bilateral CSD were 2.3 and 0.5%, respectively. Adjustment for clustering of hearing status by litter reduced the overall prevalence estimate to 1.6%. There was no association between CSD and sex (P = .2). Deaf Border Collies had higher rates of merle coat pigmentation, blue iris pigment, and excess white on the head than normal hearing Border Collies (all P < .001). The odds of deafness were increased by a factor of 14 for Border Collies with deaf dams, relative to the odds for dogs with normal dams (P = .007), after adjustment for phenotypic attributes. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Associations between CSD and pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene were demonstrated for Border Collies. Evidence for an inherited component to CSD in Border Collies supports selective breeding from only tested and normal parents to reduce the prevalence of this disease.

The goal was to determine the prevalence and effects of slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss among children in elementary school. METHODS.A cross-sectional, cluster-sample survey of 6581 children (response: 85%; grade 1: n = 3367; grade 5: n = 3214) in 89 schools in Melbourne, Australia, was performed. Slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was defined as a lowfrequency pure-tone average across 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz and/or a high-frequency pure-tone average across 3, 4, and 6 kHz of 16 to 40 dB hearing level in the better ear, with air/bone-conduction gaps of <10 dB. Parents reported children's healthrelated quality of life and behavior. Each child with slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, matched to 2 normally hearing children (low-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average of <=15 dB hearing level in both ears), completed standardized assessments. Whole-sample comparisons were adjusted for type of school, grade level, and gender, and matched-sample comparisons were adjusted for nonverbal IQ scores. RESULTS. Fifty-five children (0.88%) had slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Children with and without sensorineural hearing loss scored similarly in language (mean: 97.2 vs 99.7), reading (101.1 vs 102.8), behavior (8.4 vs 7.0), and parent- and child-reported child health-related quality of life (77.6 vs 80.0 and 76.1 vs 77.0, respectively), but phonologic short-term memory was poorer (91.0 vs 102.8) in the sensorineural hearing loss group. CONCLUSIONS. The prevalence of slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was lower than reported in previous studies. There was no strong evidence that slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss affects adversely language, reading, behavior, or health-related quality of life in children who are otherwise healthy and of normal intelligence.

Surviving auditory nerve fibers in the impaired region exhibit elevated and broadened frequency tuning, and the cochleotopic representation of broadband stimuli such as speech is distorted. In impaired cortical regions, increased tuning to frequencies near the edge of the hearing loss coupled with increased spontaneous and synchronous firing is observed. Tinnitus, an auditory percept in the absence of sensory input, may arise under these circumstances as a result of plastic reorganization in the auditory cortex. We present a spiking neuron model of auditory cortex that captures several key features of cortical organization. A key assumption in the model is that in response to reduced afferent excitatory input in the damaged region, a compensatory change in the connection strengths of lateral excitatory and inhibitory connections occurs. These changes allow the model to capture some of the cortical correlates of sensorineural hearing loss, including changes in spontaneous firing and synchrony; these phenomena may explain central tinnitus. This model may also be useful for evaluating procedures designed to segregate synchronous activity underlying tinnitus and for evaluating adaptive hearing devices that compensate for selective hearing loss. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&DO=10.1162%2fneco.2006.18.12.2942,SFX,17052154 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17052154]

Design(s): A case-control observation. Setting(s): Department of Otorhinolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Participant(s): The subjects in the normal hearing group were the 21 undergraduates (42 ears) were enrolled, they all had not any symptoms of ear disease, without history of noise exposure and disease of vestibule system, and they were normal in otoscopy. The outpatients and inpatients with neurosensory deafness were selected from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All the children cases worn hearing aids, and had the speech ability, and cooperated in the examination. The main types included 6 ears of sudden deafness, 8 ears of presbycusis, and 20 ears of neurosensory deafness due to other unknown causes. Central lesions were excluded by MR examination, and all the patients agreed with the enrollment. The results of pure-tone audiometry were all flat or descending audiogram. According to the severity of hearing damage, the patients were divided into mild deafness group (13 ears), moderate deafness group (9 ears) and moderate-to-severe deafness group (12 ears). Method(s): 1 The pure-tone audiometry was performed at the frequencies of 0.125-8 000 Hz in a sound insulation room. The auditory threshold grades of the subjects with normal hearing all accorded with the standards of GB-7583-87 expected value distribution. The average value of air-conduction auditory thresholds of pure-tone audiometry at the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz was calculated. 2 ASSR measurement was performed with the synchronous stimulation pattern in a sound and electromagnetic shielding room, including 8 points for both ears of the same stimulation intensity and the carrier frequency tones of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz respectively. 3 ABR examination was performed by click sounds with sparse waves in a sound and electromagnetic shielding room, and insert earphones were used. The threshold results were judged according to the minimal stimulation sound intensity of the distinguishable V wave. 4 The results of pure-tone audiometry were compared with those of ABR examination, and the results of ASSR measurement in different hearing groups were processed with analysis of variance, multi-classification discrimination based Bayes standard and q test. Main Outcome Measure(s): The thresholds of pure-tone audiometry, ASSR measurement and ABR examination, and the correct rate analyzed by the multi-classification discrimination based Bayes standard were mainly observed. Result(s): The indexes of the 42 ears in the normal hearing group, 13, 9 and 12 ears in the mild, moderate and moderate-to-severe deafness groups were all involved in the analysis of results. 1 The ABR values were accorded with the actual hearing levels, and the closest to the ASSR thresholds at 1-2 kHz; ASSR reflected induction rates at different frequencies were gradually decreased with the aggravation of hearing damage, and that at each frequency varied with the changes of hearing level, the induction rates of ASSR responses were all 100% for the subjects with normal hearing and patients with mild deafness, but those for the patients with moderate and moderate-to-severe deafness were decreased (0.5 kHz: 77.8%, 92.8%; 4 kHz: 88.9%, 85.7%). At different frequencies, the ASSR thresholds in the moderate-to-severe deafness group were significantly higher than those in the normal hearing group (P < 0.05). The ASSR thresholds at 0.5 and 4 kHz in the moderate-to-severe deafness group were significantly higher than those in the mild deafness group (P < 0.05). The ASSR threshold at 2 kHz in the mild deafness group was significantly higher than that in the normal hearing group (P < 0.05). The ASSR thresholds at 4 kHz in the moderate-to-severe deafness group were significantly higher than those in the normal hearing group and mild deafness group. 2 The incorrect discriminations of actual pure-tone audiometry were analyzed with the interactive clustering discriminant analysis of ASSR measurement and actual pure-tone audiometry, and the results showed that the correct rate of discrimination was 100% in the normal hearing group; Only 1 of the 12 cases in the mild deafness group was incorrectly judged, and the correct rate was 92%; Only 1 of the 19 cases in the moderate deafness group was incorrectly judged, and the correct rate was 89%; the correct rate in the moderate-to-severe deafness group was 83%. Conclusion(s): The results of ASSR measurement can detect the incorrect discrimination of objective hearing condition by taking the results of pure-tone audiometry as the standards. ASSR has an acceptable accuracy for deafness higher than mild level in estimating objective hearing, and it has a better prospect of application in practice.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=46068948,SFX,

Here, we report a family with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness whose members did not harbour the mtDNA A3243G mutation, the most frequent point mutation in mitochondrial diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate a possible other mtDNA mutation and its prevalence in type 2 diabetic patients. Method(s): Height, body weight, waistline, and hip circumference were measured and serum biochemical marks determined in all members of the family. In addition, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and electric listening test were conducted in these members. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral leukocytes. Direct sequencing of PCR products was used to detect the mtDNA mutation in this family. The prevalence of mtDNA G3421A nucleotide substitutions was investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 1350 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients recruited by random cluster sampling from the central city area of Shanghai, China. Result(s): (1) A new missense homoplasmic mutation of mtDNA G3421A was found in a maternally inherited diabetic family and existed neither in 1350 unrelated type 2 diabetic patients nor in 50 non-diabetic individuals. (2) The mode of mutation and diabetes transmission was typical maternal inheritance in this family. (3) All diabetic family members were found to have an onset at 35-42 years of age, accompanied by deafness of varying degrees. Conclusion(s): mtDNA G3421A (Val39Ile) found in a family with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness is a novel missense mutation.

The present study was conducted to examine this heterogeneity more closely, by identifying and describing subgroups within the population of children with SLI in the Netherlands. Method(s): A broad battery of language tests and language-related cognitive tests were administered to 147 six-year-old and 136 eight-year-old children with SLI. Result(s): Factor analyses revealed 4 factors indicating 4 distinctive linguistic domains for both age samples: 1) lexical-semantic abilities, 2) auditory conceptualization, 3) verbal sequential memory and 4) speech production. These empirical findings were further validated by the positive correlations found between the language factors and the judgments of teachers and speech therapists. Finally, a cluster analysis revealed 4 distinct clusters of SLI children for each sample with specific language profiles based on the 4 factors. Results were nearly the same for both age samples. Conclusion(s): The language problems that emerged from the two samples of children with SLI could be described as falling into four types.

Some subgroups had severe problems on one specific type of language problem; others had severe problems in more than one type of language problem when compared to the other subgroups of the same age sample.

Variation patterns in frequency representation among animals are incorporated into an explanatory model to reconcile heterogeneous observations. Study Design: Prospective. Method(s): Thirty-four squirrel monkeys underwent microelectrode mapping experiments in primary auditory cortex (AI) using tone pip stimuli. Characteristic frequency (CF) was extracted from the excitatory frequency receptive field. Frequency maps were reconstructed using Voronoi-Dirichlet tessellation. The spatial locations (rostral vs. caudal) of highest CF isofrequency contours (minimum length 1 mm) and highest CF neuronal clusters on the temporal gyral surface were analyzed. Result(s): Isofrequency contours at least 1 mm long with CFs greater than 2.9 kHz (75% cases) are accessible on the temporal gyrus. Variability of the highest CF isofrequency contours accessible on the temporal gyrus has an interquartile range from 2.9 to 5.1 (mean 4.3) kHz. The highest CF isofrequency contours are located mainly in rostral AI, whereas the highest CF neuronal clusters flanking fully expressed isofrequency contours are equally distributed in rostral and caudal locations. Conclusion(s): Squirrel monkey AI frequency map variations are sizeable across animals and small within single animals (interhemispheric comparison). AI frequency map variations, modeled as translations and rotations relative to the lateral sulcus, are independent transfers. Caution must be exercised when interpreting nominal frequency map changes that are attributed to hearing loss and auditory learning effects.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&DO=10.1097%2f01.MLG.0000165369.65046.CD,SFX,15995498 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995498]

In addition, semiquantitative observations were made in long-term deafened temporal bone material, focusing on the spiral ganglia and nerve projections, and a detailed study of the fine bone structure in macerated tissues was performed. Our main findings detail the presence of extensive bony fenestrae surrounding the nerve elements, permitting a relatively free flow of perilymph to modiolar structures. The clustering of the spiral ganglion cells in Rosenthal's canal and the detailed and intricate course of postganglionic axons are described. The close proximity of fibers to cell soma is demonstrated by impression in cell surfaces, and presence of small microvilli-like structures at the contact regions, anchoring nerve fibers to the cell wall. Extensive fenestrae and the presence of a fragile network of endosteal bony structures at the surfaces guiding nerve fibers are described in detail for the first time. This unique freshly prepared human material offers the opportunity for a detailed ultrastructural study not previously possible on postmortem fixed material and more accurate information to model electrostimulation of the human auditory nerve through a cochlear implant. On the basis of this study, we suggest that the concentration and high density of spiral ganglion cells, and the close physical interaction between neural elements, may explain the slow retrograde degeneration found in humans after loss of peripheral receptors.

Possible interference between fMRI acquisition and the implanted electrodes was controlled and safe experimental conditions were obtained. For each subject, electrical stimuli were applied on different intracochlear electrodes, in monopolar mode. Stimulation of each electrode was actually producing auditory sensations of different pitches, as demonstrated by psychophysical pitch-ranking measurements in the same subjects. Because deaf subjects did not hear scanner noise, the data were collected in 'silent background' conditions, i.e. as a result of pure auditory sensations. Functional maps showed activation of the primary auditory cortex, predominantly in the left hemisphere. Stimulation of each different intracochlear electrode revealed different clusters of activation. After cluster grouping, at least three regions have been identified in the auditory cortex of each subject, and comparisons with previous architectonic and functional studies are proposed. However, a tonotopic organization could not be clearly identified within each region.

Removal of betaIVSIGMA1 alone causes the disappearance of the nodal coat, an increased diameter of the NR, and the presence of dilations filled with organelles. Moreover, in myelinated cochlear afferent fibers, VGSC and ankyrin G clusters appear fragmented.

The same pattern of Kv3.1, CREB, and pCREB localization was also found in young BL/6 mice at a time (6 weeks) when hearing is normal. In contrast, at 8 months, when hearing is impaired, the gradient of Kv3.1 was abolished. Moreover, in the older BL/6 mice there was a decrease in CREB expression along the tonotopic axis, and the pattern of pCREB labeling appeared random, with no discrete clusters of pCREB-positive cells along the tonotopic axis.

Ears were split into training (n = 176) and validation (n = 80) sets. Input variables included gender, age, examination time, DPOAE intensity at f2 frequencies 593, 937, 1906, 3812 and 6031 Hz, and respective values corrected for noise levels. In the validation data set, an average network had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (accuracy 84%). Logistic regressions including all these variables or those selected by backward elimination had AUC values of 0.91 and 0.92, respectively (accuracy 85% both). Eleven of 12 trained networks had better specificity than the backward elimination logistic regression, and the backward elimination logistic regression had a better sensitivity than 11 of the 12 networks. Both modeling approaches correctly identified all ears with sudden hearing loss, congenital hearing loss, head trauma, nuclear jaundice and ototoxicity, and 2-3 of 5 ears with acoustic trauma, but missed 1-3 of 3 ears with Meniere's disease and 4-6 of 8 ears with abnormal pure-tone thresholds on audiometry which had no accompanying findings.

Since the threshold of the NRT response (NRT-T) is thought to reflect the psychophysics needed for programming cochlear implants, efforts have been made by specialized management teams to develop its use. This study aimed at developing a valid tool, based on artificial neural networks (ANN) technology, for automatic estimation of NRT-T. The ANN used was a single layer perceptron, trained with 120 NRT traces. Learning traces differed from data used for the validation. A total of 550 NRT traces from 11 cochlear implant subjects were analyzed separately by the system and by a group of physicians with expertise in NRT analysis. Both worked to determine 37 NRT-T values, using the response amplitude growth function (AGF) (linear regression of response amplitudes obtained at decreasing stimulus intensity levels). The validity of the system was assessed by comparing the NRT-T values automatically determined by the system with those determined by the physicians. A strong correlation was found between automatic and physician-obtained NRT-T values (Pearson r correlation coefficient >0.9). ANOVA statistics confirmed that automatic NRT-Ts did not differ from physician-obtained values (F=0.08999, P=0.03). Moreover, the average error between NRT-Ts predicted by the system and NRT-Ts measured by the physicians (3.6 stimulation units) did not differ significantly from the average error between NRT-Ts measured by each of the three physicians (4.2 stimulation units). In conclusion, the automatic system developed in this study was found to be as efficient as human experts for fitting the amplitude growth function and estimating NRT-T, with the advantage of considerable time-saving. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, a reliable and automated detection of the beta-wave capable of clinical use still remains a challenge. We propose a new machine learning approach to the detection of the CAPD that is based on adapted tight frame decompositions which are tailored for support vector machines with radial kernels. Using shift-invariant scale and morphological features of the binaurally evoked brainstem potentials, our approach provides at least comparable results to the beta-wave detection in view of the discrimination of subjects being at risk for CAPD and subjects being not at risk for CAPD. Furthermore, as no information from the monaurally potentials is necessary, the measurement cost is reduced by two-thirds compared to the computation of the binaural interaction component.

Speech processors that extract only envelopes of the narrow-band signals (e.g., the continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) processor) may not provide sufficient information to encode the tonal cues in languages such as Chinese. To improve the performance in cochlear implant users who speak tonal language, we proposed and developed a novel speech-processing strategy, which extracted both the envelopes of the narrow-hand signals and the fundamental frequency (Fo) of the speech signal, and used them to modulate both the amplitude and the frequency of the electrical pulses delivered to stimulation electrodes. We developed an algorithm to extract the fundamental frequnency and identified the general patterns of pitch variations of four typical tones in Chinese speech. The effectiveness of the extraction algorithm was verified with an artificial neural network that recognized the tonal patterns from the extracted Fo information. We then compared the novel strategy with the envelope-extraction CIS strategy in human subjects with normal hearing. The novel strategy produced significant improvement in perception of Chinese tones, phrases, and sentences. This novel processor with dynamic modulation of both frequency and amplitude is encouraging for the design of a cochlear implant device for sensorineurally deaf patients who speak tonal languages.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed8&DO=10.1109%2fTBME.2004.826597,SFX,15132501 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15132501]

LTCC currents have been implicated in neurotransmitter release at the HC afferent active zone, the ribbon synapse. It is likely that LTCCs play a direct role in vesicle fusion; however, the subcellular localization of the channels in HCs has not been fully resolved. Via positional cloning, we show that mutations in a zebrafish LTCC encoding gene, cav1.3a, underlie the auditory-vestibular defects of gemini (gem) circler mutants. gem homozygous receptor mutant HCs display normal cell viability, afferent synaptogenesis, and peripheral innervation, yet exhibit strongly reduced extracellular potentials (~50% of wild-type potentials). Apical FM1-43 uptake, however, is unaffected in gem mutant HCs, suggesting that mechanotransduction channels are functional. Using a Gem-specific antibody, we show that the bulk of Gem/Cav1.3a immunoreactivity in HCs is restricted to basally located focal spots. The number and location of focal spots relative to nerve terminals, and their remarkable ring-shaped structure, which is reminiscent of synaptic dense bodies, are consistent with Gem/Ca v1.3a channels clustering at HC ribbon synapses.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed8&DO=10.1523%2fJNEUROSCI.0223-04.2004,SFX,15115817 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15115817]

A better understanding of the tonotopy of the central nervous system segment of the cochlear nerve and of the pathophysiology of tinnitus might help to ameliorate the disappointing results obtained with microvascular decompressions in patients with tinnitus. METHOD(S): We assume that vascular compression of the cochlear nerve can induce a frequency-specific form of hearing loss and that when the nerve is successfully decompressed, this hearing loss can recuperate. Thirty-one patients underwent a microvascular decompression of the vestibulocochlear nerve for vertigo or tinnitus. Preoperative audiograms were subtracted from postoperative audiograms, regardless of the surgical result with regard to the tinnitus and vertigo, because the hearing improvement could be the only sign of the vascular compression. The frequency of maximal improvement was then correlated to the site of vascular compression. A tonotopy of the cochlear nerve was thus obtained. RESULT(S): A total of 18 correlations can be made between the site of compression and postoperative maximal hearing improvement frequency when 5-dB hearing improvement is used as threshold, 13 when 10-dB improvement is used as threshold. A clear distribution can be seen, with clustering of low frequencies at the posterior and inferior side of the cochlear nerve, close to the brainstem, and close to the root exit zone of the facial nerve. High frequencies are distributed closer to the internal acoustic meatus and more superiorly along the posterior aspect of the cochlear nerve. CONCLUSION(S): The tonotopic organization of the cisternal segment of the cochlear nerve has an oblique rotatory structure as a result of the rotatory course of the cochlear nerve in the posterior fossa. Knowledge of this tonotopic organization of the auditory nerve in its cisternal course might benefit surgeons who perform microvascular decompression operations for the vestibulocochlear compression syndrome, especially in the treatment of unilateral severe tinnitus.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed8&DO=10.1227%2f01.NEU.0000103420.53487.79,SFX,14744285 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14744285]

The tonotopic organization of MGv in the lesioned animals, with severe mid-to-high frequency hearing losses, was investigated 40-186 days following the lesioning procedure. Frequency maps were generated from neural responses to pure tone bursts presented separately to each ear under barbiturate anesthesia. Consideration of the frequency organization in normal animals, and of the apparently normal representation of the ipsilateral (unlesioned) cochlea in lesioned animals, allowed for a detailed specification of the extent of changes observed in MGv. In the lesioned animals it was found that, in the region of MGv in which mid-to-high frequencies are normally represented, there was an ""expanded representation"" of lesion-edge frequencies. Neuron clusters within these regions of enlarged representation that had ""new"" characteristic frequencies displayed response properties (latency, bandwidth) very similar to those in normal animals. Thresholds of these neurons were not consistent with the argument that the changes merely reflect the residue of prelesion responses, suggesting a dynamic process of reorganization. The tonotopic reorganization observed in MGv is similar to that seen in the primary auditory cortex and is more extensive than the reorganization found in the auditory midbrain, suggesting that the auditory thalamus plays an important role in cortical plasticity. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed8&DO=10.1002%2fcne.10586,SFX,12687704 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12687704]

Fifty-two subjects with prelingual hearing impairment (47 hearing aid users and 5 cochlear implant users) were examined. Result(s): Hearing aid users with average pure-tone thresholds less than 90 dB HL demonstrated generally better monosyllable perception than 70%, which was equivalent or better performance than that of the cochlear implant group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen children with speech delay (age range, 2-7 years; mean, 4.0 years) and 35 age-matched children with normal speech (age range, 2-8 years; mean, 4.2 years) were evaluated. The subjects in the control group were selected from patients referred for conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. All children had absence of auditory impairment or mental retardation, and MR findings indicated that brain structure was normal. Sedation was achieved with pentobarbital (3-5 mg/kg) or chloral hydrate (75 mg/kg). Functional MR imaging was performed with a single-shot echo-planar blood oxygen-level-dependent technique and a passive block paradigm, in which the child listened to his or her mother's prerecorded voice. Statistical postprocessing of functional MR images was performed with the t test and cluster detection methods. Comparison between groups was performed depending on the type of data with a nonparametrical Mann-Whitney test, parametrical t test, or Fisher exact test. RESULT(S): Five (83%) of the six children older than 3 years with speech delay had lateralized activation of functional MR imaging signal in the right hemisphere. Ten (71%) of 14 age-matched patients with normal speech had activation in the left hemisphere when exposed to the same passive listening tasks. When these groups were compared, this difference was statistically significant. (P = .036). No statistically significant lateralization was seen across all age groups in children with activation. CONCLUSION(S): Children older than 3 years with speech delay have activation in the right hemisphere more frequently than children older than 3 years with normal speech, who often have the expected finding of activation in the left hemisphere. © RSNA, 2003.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed8&DO=10.1148%2fradiol.2293021746,SFX,14657303 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14657303]

A fundamental challenge in auditory neuroscience is to understand the neural and perceptual mechanisms that make rehabilitation of hearing possible in these deaf humans. We have developed a feline behavioral model that allows us to study behavioral and physiological variables in the same deaf animals. Cats deafened by injection of ototoxic antibiotics were implanted with either a monopolar round window electrode or a multichannel scala tympani electrode array. To evaluate the effects of perceptually significant electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve on the central auditory system, an animal was trained to avoid a mild electrocutaneous shock when biphasic current pulses (0.2 ms/phase) were delivered to its implanted cochlea. Psychophysical detection thresholds and electrical auditory brain stem response (EABR) thresholds were estimated in each cat. At the conclusion of behavioral testing, acute physiological experiments were conducted, and threshold responses were recorded for single neurons and multineuronal clusters in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the primary auditory cortex (A1). Behavioral and neurophysiological thresholds were evaluated with reference to cochlear histopathology in the same deaf cats. The results of the present study include: 1) in the cats implanted with a scala tympani electrode array, the lowest ICC and A1 neural thresholds were virtually identical to the behavioral thresholds for intracochlear bipolar stimulation; 2) behavioral thresholds were lower than ICC and A1 neural thresholds in each of the cats implanted with a monopolar round window electrode; 3) EABR thresholds were higher than behavioral thresholds in all of the cats (mean difference = 6.5 dB); and 4) the cumulative number of action potentials for a sample of ICC neurons increased monotonically as a function of the amplitude and the number of stimulating biphasic pulses. This physiological result suggests that the output from the ICC may be integrated spatially across neurons and temporally integrated across pulses when the auditory nerve array is stimulated with a train of biphasic current pulses. Because behavioral thresholds were lower and reaction times were faster at a pulse rate of 30 pps compared with a pulse rate of 2 pps, spatial-temporal integration in the central auditory system was presumably reflected in psychophysical performance.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed7&DO=10.1152%2fjn.2000.83.4.2145,SFX,10758124 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10758124]

All existing studies addressed children 3 years of age or older. Currently, OME is detected and treated with ventilation tubes at a younger age. Because of the critical relationship between age, hearing, and language development, we conducted a study of the effects of ventilation tubes on language development in infants 1 to 2 years old with persistent OME. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (embedded in a cohort) with 2 treatment arms: 1) treatment with ventilation tubes (VT group; n = 93); or 2) with a period of watchful waiting (WW group; n = 94). Hearing loss and expressive and comprehensive language were assessed every 6 months, while tympanometry and otoscopy were performed every 3 months. Other factors with potential influence on language development were also included: adenoidectomy, hospital, attending day care, sex, age at randomization, educational level of the mother, upper respiratory infections, and the native country of the parents and older siblings. The trial was designed to allow for the detection of a mean difference in language development of 3 months or more between children allocated to the VT and WW groups. RESULT(S): No relevant differences were found in expressive or comprehensive language between the 2 groups after adjustment for educational level of the mother, IQ of the child, and differences at baseline. A principal component analysis showed that in the VT group, the children with frequent complaints improved 1.6 months more in comprehensive language than those with no or some complaints. The children with favorable language stimulation, however, did not improve more than the children with less favorable stimulation. No differences were found for expressive language among the various clusters. The probability to improve >3 months in comprehensive language was.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]:.29-.68) for children with highly educated mothers versus.09 (95% CI:.02-.30) for children whose mothers had a low educational level. In the WW group, these changes were.30 (95% CI:.14-.53) and.14 (95% CI:.04-.35), respectively. The probability to improve >4 months in expressive language was.52 (95% CI:.32-.71) for children with highly educated mothers versus.06 (95% CI:.01-.31) for children whose mothers had a low educational level. In the WW group these changes were.42 (95% CI:.23-.64) and.11 (95% CI:.03-.35), respectively. In addition, there were delays in expressive language in both groups compared with their age expected values. The comprehensive language of the children who were effusion-free during the follow-up (n = 54) improved 1.5 months (95% CI: -.2-3.2) more than that of the children who had persistent effusion during the entire follow-up (n = 28). No differences were found for expressive language development. Disregarding the intervention contrast, improvements in hearing seemed to be related to improvements in language development, especially in verbal comprehension. DISCUSSION: In this study, we used the Reynell, Schlichting, and Lexi tests to study the relation between early persistent OME and language development. These tests are directly related to normal language, widely accepted, and validated. It cannot be ruled out that more specific measures such as auditory perception tests would have produced more differences between groups, but the focus was on general language development. A total of 10 children in the WW group received treatment with ventilation tubes during follow-up. A further 11 children dropped out during the trial. A sensitivity analysis with the 10 children who received ventilation tubes did not change the results, and baseline differences were not found between the 11 children who dropped out and those who completed the trial.

Method(s): Data on the children's aetiology of hearing loss, hearing status, tympanometric findings and the electroacoustic characteristics of their hearing aids were obtained. For 424 children's ears considered having essentially sensorineural hearing loss, k-means cluster analysis methods were used to categorize audiometric configuration groups Results: Cluster analysis that indicated that five distinct audiometric configurations could be found among the school children.

Conclusion(s): The amplification needs associated with these five configurations, including recommended prescription gain, maximum power output and possible signal processing strategies, were considered.

Analysis of the first set of 4304 ESTs revealed clones representing 517 known human genes, 41 mammalian genes not previously detected in human tissues, 487 ESTs from other human tissues, and 541 cochlear-specific ESTs (http://hearing.bwh.harvard.edu). We now report results of a DNA sequence similarity (BLAST) analysis of an additional 4190 cochlear ESTs and a comparison to the first set. Among the 4190 new cochlear ESTs, 959 known human genes were identified; 594 were found only among the new ESTs and 365 were found among ESTs from both sequencing projects. COL1A2 was the most abundant transcript among both sets of ESTs, followed in order by COL3A1, SPARC, EEF1A1, and TPTI. An additional 22 human homologs of known nonhuman mammalian genes and 1595 clusters of ESTs, of which 333 are cochlear-specific, were identified among the new cochlear ESTs. Map positions were determined for 373 of the new cochlear ESTs and revealed 318 additional loci. Forty-nine of the mapped ESTs are located within the genetic interval of 23 deafness loci. Reanalysis of unassigned ESTs from the prior study revealed 338 additional known human genes. The total number of known human genes identified from 8494 cochlear ESTs is 1449 and is represented by 4040 ESTs. Among the known human genes are 14 deafness-associated genes, including GJB2 (connexin 26) and KVLQT1. The total number of nonhuman mammalian genes identified is 43 and is represented by 58 ESTs. The total number of ESTs without sequence similarity to known genes is 4055. Of these, 778 also do not have sequence similarity to any other ESTs, are categorized into 700 clusters, and may represent genes uniquely or preferentially expressed in the cochlea.

We tested the accuracy of coding of the place of stimulation (i.e., identification of the active stimulation channel) and of the stimulus current level. Physiological data came from the companion study, which recorded spike activity of neurons simultaneously from 16 sites along the tonotopic axis of the guinea pig's auditory cortex. In that study, cochlear electrical stimuli were presented to acutely deafened animals through a 6-electrode animal version of the 22-electrode Nucleus banded electrode array (Cochlear). Cochlear electrode configurations consisted of monopolar (MP), bipolar (BP + N) with N inactive electrodes between the active and return electrodes (0 <= N <= 3), tripolar (TP) with one active electrode and two flanking return electrodes, and common ground (CG) with one active electrode and as many as five return electrodes. In the present analysis, an artificial neural network was trained to recognize spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activity in response to single presentations of particular stimuli and, thereby, to identify those stimuli. The accuracy of pair-wise discrimination of stimulation channels or of current levels was represented by the discrimination index, d', where d' = 1 was taken as threshold. In many cases, the threshold for discrimination of place of cochlear stimulation was <0.75 mm, and the threshold for discrimination of current levels was <1 dB. Cochlear electrode configurations varied in the accuracy with which they signaled to the auditory cortex the place of cochlear stimulation. The BP + N and TP configurations provided considerably greater sensitivity to place of stimulation than did the MP configuration. The TP configuration maintained accurate signaling of place of stimulation up to the highest current levels, whereas sensitivity was degraded at high current levels in BP + N configurations. Electrode configurations also varied in the dynamic range over which they signaled stimulus current level. Dynamic ranges were widest for the BP + 0 configuration and narrowest for the TP configuration. That is, the configuration that showed the most accurate signaling of cochlear place of stimulation (TP) showed the most restricted dynamic range for signaling of current level. These results suggest that the choice of the optimal electrode configuration for use by human cochlear-prosthesis users would depend on the particular demands of the speech-processing strategy that is to be employed.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed7&DO=10.1152%2fjn.00211.2001,SFX,11784765 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11784765]

Only two of these loci are associated with an auditory phenotype that predominantly affects the low frequencies (DFNA1 and DFNA6/14). In this study, we have completed mutation screening of the WFS1 gene in eight autosomal dominant families and twelve sporadic cases in which affected persons have low-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment (LFSNHI). Mutations in this gene are known to be responsible for Wolfram syndrome or DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness), which is an autosomal recessive trait. We have identified seven missense mutations and a single amino acid deletion affecting conserved amino acids in six families and one sporadic case, indicating that mutations in WFS1 are a major cause of inherited but not sporadic low-frequency hearing impairment. Among the ten WFS1 mutations reported in LFSNHI, none is expected to lead to premature protein truncation, and nine cluster in the C-terminal protein domain. In contrast, 64% of the Wolfram syndrome mutations are inactivating. Our results indicate that only non-inactivating mutations in WFS1 are responsible for non-syndromic low-frequency hearing impairment. © Springer-Verlag 2002.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed7&DO=10.1007%2fs00439-002-0719-1,SFX,12073007 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12073007]

One of the factors that may lead to this performance gap is the inadequate signal processing method used in CIs. This paper investigates the application of an improved signal-processing method called bionic wavelet transform (BWT). This method is based upon the auditory model and allows for signal processing. Comparing the neural network simulations on the same experimental materials processed by wavelet transform (WT) and BWT, the application of BWT to speech signal processing in CI has a number of advantages, including: improvement in recognition rates for both consonants and vowels, reduction of the number of required channels, reduction of the average stimulation duration for words, and high noise tolerance. Consonant recognition results in 15 normal hearing subjects show that the BWT produces significantly better performance than the WT (t = -4.36276, p = 0.00065). The BWT has great potential to reduce the performance gap between CI listeners and people with a normal hearing capability in the future.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed7&DO=10.1109%2fTBME.2002.804590,SFX,12450360 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12450360]

Box 211, Amsterdam 1000 AE, Netherlands)","The C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains of mice exhibit an age-related hearing loss (AHL) due to a recessive gene (Ahl) that maps to Chromosome 10. The Ahl gene is also implicated in the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The B6 mice (Ahl/Ahl) are more susceptible to NIHL than the CBA/CaJ (CB) mice (+Ahl). The B6xD2.F1 hybrid mice (Ahl/Ahl) are more susceptible to NIHL than the CBxB6.F1 mice (+/Ahl) [Erway et al., 1996. Hear. Res. 93, 181-187]. These genetic effects implicate the Ahl gene as contributing to NIHL susceptibility. The present study demonstrates segregation for the putative Ahl gene and mapping of such a gene to Chromosome 10, consistent with other independent mapping of Ahl for AHL in 10 strains of mice [Johnson et al., 2000. Genomics 70, 171-180]. The present study was based on a conventional cross between two inbred strains, CBxB6.F1 backcrossed to B6 with segregation for the putative +/Ahl:Ahl/Ahl. These backcross progeny were exposed to 110 dB SPL noise for 8 h. All of the progeny were tested for auditory evoked brainstem responses and analyzed for any significant permanent threshold shift of NIHL. Cluster analyses were used to distinguish the two putative genotypes, the least affected with NIHL (+/Ahl) and most affected with PTS (Ahl/Ahl). Approximately 1/2 of the backcross progeny exhibited PTS, particularly at 16 kHz. These mice were genotyped for two D10Mit markers. Quantitative trait loci analyses (log of the odds=15) indicated association of the genetic factor within a few centiMorgan of the best evidence for Ahl [Johnson et al., 2000. Genomics 70, 171-180]. All of the available evidence supports a role for the Ahl gene in both AHL and NIHL among these strains of mice.

Here we reviewed more than 40 recent papers of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging related to language auditory perception, and we performed a meta-analysis of the localization of the peaks of activation in the Talairach's space. We found 8 studies reporting word versus non-word listening contrasts with 54 activation peaks in the temporal lobes. These peaks clustered in a bilateral and well-limited area of the temporal superior cortex, which is here operationally defined as the speech sensitive auditory cortex. This area is more than 4cm long, located in the superior temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus, both anterior and posterior to Heschl's gyrus. It do not include the primary auditory cortex nor the ascending part of the planum temporale. The speech sensitive auditory cortex is not activated by pure tones, environmental sounds, or attention directed toward elementary components of a sound such as intensity, pitch, or duration, and thus has some specificity for speech signals. The specificity is not perfect, since we found a number of non-speech auditory stimuli activating the speech sensitive auditory cortex. Yet the latter studies always involve auditory perception mechanisms which are also relevant to speech perception either at the level of primitive auditory scene analysis processes, or at the level of specific schema-based recognition processes. The dorsal part of the speech sensitive auditory cortex may be involved in primitive scene analysis processes, whereas distributed activation of this area may contribute to the emergence of a broad class of << voice >> schemas and of more specific << speech sche- mas/phonetic modules >> related to different languages. In addition, this area is activated by language-related lip movement, suggesting that a multimodal integration of the auditory and the visual information relevant in speech perception occurs at this level. Finally, there is a task- related top-down modulation of the pattern of activation of the speech sensitive auditory cortex which may reflect the fact that the different parts of this structure are connected to different down-stream cortical regions involved in the neural processing of different types of tasks.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed7&AN=32937268,SFX,11677406 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11677406]

The outcomes of treatment of chronic otitis media (CSOM) are disappointing and uncertain, especially in developing countries. Because CSOM is the commonest cause of hearing impairment in children in these countries, an effective method of management that can be implemented on a wide scale is needed. We report a randomised, controlled trial of treatment of CSOM among children in Kenya; unaffected schoolchildren were taught to administer the interventions. Methods. We enrolled 524 children with CSOM, aged 5-15 years, from 145 primary schools in Kiambu district of Kenya. The schools were randomly assigned treatments in clusters of five in a ratio of two to dry mopping alone (201 children), two to dry mopping with topical and systemic antibiotics and topical steroids (221 children), and one to no specific treatment (102 children). Schools were matched on factors thought to be related to their socioeconomic status. The primary outcome measures were resolution of otorrhoea and healing of tympanic membranes on otoscopy by 8, 12, and 16 weeks after induction. Absence of perforation was confirmed by tympanometry, and hearing levels were assessed by audiometry. 29 children were withdrawn from the trial because they took non-trial antibiotics. There was no evidence of differences in timing of withdrawals between the groups. Findings. By the 16-week follow-up visit, otorrhoea had resolved in a weighted mean proportion of 51% (95% CI 42-59) of children who received dry mopping with antibiotics, compared with 22% (14-31) of those who received dry mopping alone and 22% (9-35) of controls. Similar differences were recorded by the 8-week and 12-week visits. The weighted mean proportions of children with healing of the tympanic membranes by 16 weeks were 15% (10-21) in the dry-mopping plus antibiotics group, 13% (5-20) in the dry-mopping alone group, and 13% (3-23) in the control group. The proportion with resolution in the dry-mopping alone group did not differ significantly from that in the control group at any time. Hearing thresholds were significantly better for children with no otorrhoea at 16 weeks than for those who had otorrhoea, and were also significantly better for those whose ears had healed than for those with otorrhoea at all times. Interpretation. Our finding that dry mopping plus topical and systemic antibiotics is superior to dry mopping alone contrasts with that of the only previous community-based trial in a developing country, though it accords with findings of most other trials in developed countries. The potential role of antibiotics needs further investigation. Further, similar trials are needed to identify the most cost-effective and appropriate treatment regimen for CSOM in children in developing countries.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed6&DO=10.1016%2fS0140-6736%252896%252909388-9,SFX,8888166 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8888166]

One hundred and fifty-one patients (67 males and 84 females) with Meniere's disease were treated in the Neuro-otological clinic, Kitasato University Hospital from 1990 to 1995. Ages ranged from 17 to 77 years (mean 47.3 years) at the onset of the disease when the first vertigo attack occurred. There were 106 (70.1%) in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and 28 (18.5%) aged 60 years or over. Seventy-eight patients visited the clinic within one year of the onset of the disease, but the mean interval was 4 years and 5 months (the longest was 25 years). The mean duration time for the follow-up studies from the time of their first visit to the hospital was 2 years and 5 months. The bilateral ears were invaded in 19 patients (12.6%) and the mean length of their time course was 9 years and 10 months which is longer than the length in unilateral cases. Several important key points for diagnosis of Meniere's disease were investigated in 28 of the 151 cases who had been followed up successfully over a relatively long time course (the mean follow-up time was 7 years and 3 months). Fluctuated or stational cochlear signs, such as tinnitus, hearing impairment and/or fullness in the ear, had started prior to the onset of the first vertigo attack in 17 (61%) of 28 cases. Vertigo without cochlear sign appearing at the onset and cochlear signs were combined later in six (21%) of the 28 cases. Only five (18%) of the 28 cases had vertigo combined with a cochlear sign simultaneously at the onset of the disease. The affected ear was on the left in 15 cases and on the right in seven of 22 unilateral cases. In six bilateral cases the left ear was the first to be invaded in four out of six cases. The interval between the first and second attacks was over 1 year in six of the 28 cases and over 6 months in 10 of the 28 cases. Nine out of the 28 patients had recurrence of vertigo attacks during the first month and five of the nine had a cluster of attacks in the first month. Our study of 28 patients over a long time course revealed eight patients (28.6%) free from the disease. These patients had no recurrence of vertigo for more than 2 years after their last attack, and sixteen (57.1%) of the 28 patients had no recurrence of vertigo for more than 1 year. However, a long period of relief time of more than 2 years in 11 of the 28 patients and a period of more than I year was noticed in 16 of the 28 patients. Hearing levels at the middle and low frequencies in the firrst hearing test were compared with the last test. The mean of hearing levels changed from 38.1 to 36.2 dB after 2 years and I month in six cases with the right ear affected and from 34.1 to 45.3 dB after 5 years and 3 months in 15 cases with the left ear affected, but in seven cases with bilateral diseased ears the hearing in both ears became worse, from 25.5 to 57.1 dB in the right ear and from 30.5 to 53.6 dB in the left ear during a period of more than 10 years.

Several studies have demonstrated that, in fact, performance of a test battery can be inferior to the best of the tests it includes. These studies have been quite persuasive in damping enthusiasm for the test battery approach. Because the results of all tests in a battery were weighted equally in these studies, it is not surprising that an individual test with good sensitivity and specificity is more effective diagnostically than a combination of tests with poorer sensitivity and specificity. The authors of many of these studies were well aware of the limitations of this approach. In the present study, neural networks were applied to evaluate audiological tests used to predict retrocochlear pathology by differentially weighting the results of the tests in the battery. This technique avoids some of the limitations of previous approaches. Of the audiological tests evaluated in the present analysis, the superiority of the auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) in predicting retrocochlear disease was again demonstrated. However, the results also demonstrated that identification accuracy could be improved by combining the ABR with other tests (in this case contralateral acoustic reflex at 2000 Hz, ipsilateral acoustic reflex at 2000 Hz, tone decay, and word recognition score). Further, it was demonstrated that performance could be improved over that obtained using dichotomous test measures (i.e., positive or negative presence of pathology) by using raw test measures in conjunction with ABR.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed6&DO=10.1044%2fjslhr.4202.287,SFX,10229447 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10229447]

However, a significant threshold elevation (above 5 dB SPL) occurred in high-frequency areas (16 and 20 kHz) on day 2, and in middle frequency areas (10 and 12 kHz) on day 5 with sensorineural hearing loss type intensity-latency curves. By day 14, the elevated thresholds had returned to pre-instillation levels. In the lowest areas (4 and 8 kHz), no significant threshold elevation was detected at any time during the observation period. By light microscopy, on day 1, clusters of inflammatory cells (predominantly neutrophils) were observed just outside the round window membrane (RWM), while only a few neutrophils were detected in the cochlea. These cells were still present outside the RWM on day 2. The neutrophils had disappeared by day 5 and only macrophages were present on the middle ear side of the RWM.

Until now methods have been either subjective or based on arbitrary response characteristics. This study takes an expert system approach to standardize the subjective judgements of an experienced scorer. The method that is developed comprises three stages. First, it transforms TEOAEs from waveforms in the time domain into a simplified parameter set. Second, the parameter set is classified by an artifical neural network that has been taught on a large database TEOAE waveforms and corresponding expert scores. Third, additional fuzzy logic rules automatically detect probable artefacts in the waveforms and synchronized spontaneous emission components. In this way, the knowledge of the experienced scorer is encapsulated in the expert system software and thereafter can be accessed by non-experts. Teaching and evaluation of the neural network was based on TEOAEs from a database totalling 2190 neonatal hearing screening tests. The database was divided into learning and test groups with 820 and 1370 waveforms respectively. From each recorded waveform a set of 12 parameters was calculated, representing signal static and dynamic properties. The artifical network was taught with parameter sets of only the learning groups. Reproduction of the human scorer classification by the neural net in the learning group showed a sensitivity for detecting screen fails of 99.3% (299 from 301 failed results on subjective scoring) and a specificity for detecting screen passes of 81.1% (421 of 519 pass results). To quantify the post hoc performance of the net (generalization), the test group was then presented to the network input. Sensitivity was 99.4% (474 from 477) and specificity was 87.3% (780 from 893). To check the efficiency of the classification method, a second learning group was selected out of the previous test group, and the previous learning group was used as the test group. Repeating learning and test procedures yielded 99.3% sensitivity and 80.7% specificity for reproduction, and 99.4% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity for generalization. In all respects, performance was better than for a previously optimized method based simply on cross-correlation between replicate non-linear waveforms.

We apply these methods to construct percentiles of hearing level using data from a carefully screened sample of women from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.

In addition, the distribution of the hearing levels is not symmetric about the mean.

We use a transformation of the hearing levels to provide for skewness in the final percentile curves. The change in the variation of the residuals and random effects is modelled as a function of beginning age and frequency and we use this variance function to construct the hearing percentiles. We present a number of approaches. First, we use the absolute values of the population residuals to model the total deviation about the mean as a function of beginning age and frequency.

The subjects were divided into 8 groups according to their ages in increments of 5 years. Their audiograms were obtained annually, and the results were used to obtain the distribution of the hearing level at each test frequency. All of the subjects were examined for individual changes in audiograms and those who showed 20 dB or more aggravation of hearing in a 1-year period without subsequent improvement were defined as having a rapid phase of aggravation. There were clustering points in hearing distribution at around 30 dB and 60 dB at the test frequency of 8 kHz in those subjects showing a rapid phase of aggravation. Similar clustering points were also noted in those subjects who showed gradual aggravation of 20 dB or more in a 5-year period and who had 20 dB or more aggravation in one year but showed later improvement. As for the test frequencies lower than 4 kHz, there appeared to be a clustering point at around 30 dB. The incidence of the rapid phase of aggravation was then determined in each group, in order to investigate the relationship between aging and the appearance of the rapid phase of aggravation. The rapid phase was already noted in the youngest age group (range, 35-39 years), while the incidence gradually increased up to the 50-54-year group and stayed at a constant level in the 55-69-year groups. The incidence markedly decreased thereafter. The results suggest that hearing aggravation due to aging does not occur at any particular age.

The individuals with moderate-to- profound hearing loss had good to excellent oral communication skills. Intraoral pressure, nasal air flow, durations of lip, velum, and vocal fold articulations, estimated subglottal pressure, mean phonatory air flow fundamental frequency, and EGG abduction quotient were compared between the two subject groups. Data from the subjects with hearing loss also were compared across aided and unaided conditions to investigate the influence of auditory feedback on speech motor control. The speakers with hearing loss had significantly higher intraoral pressures, subglottal pressures, laryngeal resistances, and fundamental frequencies than those with normal hearing. There was notable between-subject variability. All of the individuals with profound hearing loss had at least one speech/voice physiology measure that fell outside of the normal range, and most of the subjects demonstrated unique clusters of abnormal behaviors. Abnormal behaviors were more evident in the phonatory than articulatory or velopharyngeal systems and were generally consistent with vocal fold hyperconstriction. There was evidence from individual data that vocal fold posturing influenced articulatory timing. The results did not support the idea that the speech production skills of adults with moderate-to-profound hearing loss who are good oral communicators deteriorate when there are increased motoric demands on the velopharyngeal and phonatory mechanism. Although no significant differences were found between the aided and unaided conditions, 7 of 10 subjects showed the same direction of change for subglottal pressure, intraoral pressure, nasal air flow, and the duration of lip and vocal fold articulations.

After 12-24 months the response properties of single neurons or small unit clusters in primary auditory cortex were recorded in anesthetized animals. Responses to stimulus frequency and intensity were mapped in detail and frequency threshold curves (FTCs) and Q(10dB) values were derived. Subsequent to recording experiments, scanning electron microscopy of the sensory epithelium was used to characterize the degree and extent of the cochlear damage. In normal control animals, Q(10dB) values were, on average, lower than those derived by others from cochlear nerve fibre recordings in the same species. In amikacin-treated animals, deterioration was evident in the threshold and tuning properties of cortical neurons, particularly in those cells whose input originated in damaged cochlear regions. Often, neurons associated with 'normal' cochlear areas (as assessed by scanning microscopy) also had poor frequency tuning compared with controls. As an animal model of sensorineural hearing loss, we consider the cat with long-term cochlear lesions to be more appropriate than animals with acute or short-term pathology.

As progressive loss of high frequency sensitivity ensued peripherally, a substantially increased representation of middle frequencies was observed in AI.

These lesions, although restricted in spatial extent, resulted in a variety of patterns of histological damage to receptor cells and nerve fibres within the cochlea. Nevertheless, all lesions resulted in permanent losses of sensitivity of the cochlear neural output across a limited frequency range. Thirty-five to 81 days after such damage to the organ of Corti, the area of contralateral auditory cortex in which the lesioned frequency range would normally have been represented was partly occupied by an expanded representation of sound frequencies adjacent to the frequency range damaged by the lesion. The thresholds at their new characteristic frequencies (CFs) of clusters of cortical neurones in these regions were close to normal thresholds at those frequencies (mean difference across all animals was 3.8 dB). In a second series of experiments, the responses of neurone clusters were examined within hours of making similar cochlear lesions. It was found that shifts in CF toward frequencies spared by the lesions could occur, but thresholds were greatly elevated compared to normal (mean difference was 31.7 dB in five animals). The emergence of sensitive drive in such regions after prolonged recovery periods in lesioned animals thus suggests that the auditory cortical frequency map undergoes reorganization in cases of partial deafness. Some features of this reorganization are similar to changes reported in somatosensory cortex after peripheral nerve injury, and this form of plasticity may therefore be a feature of all adult sensory systems.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed4&DO=10.1002%2fcne.902820311,SFX,2715393 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2715393]

Two results are of interest: 1) The configuration of the audiograms and 2) The percentage incidence of the individual forms of development in the random samples. The audiograms of two large collectives of workers who are exposed to noise are subjected to such an analysis. These audiograms have been obtained from serial examinations (n = 24936) and from specialist's opinions which were established following a report of occupational disease (n = 1515). As was to be expected, the two groups differ from each other in the degree of their hearing impairment. This is due to the different threshold losses for tones in the high frequency and middle frequency ranges. In the low-tone range, however, the hearing capacity of nearly all of the persons examined was intact. Hearing impairment in the frequency range 100-500 Hz was found only in a small proportion of the studied cases. The question regarding the noise causality of the cases is important, not only for pathogenetic but also for economic reasons (obligation for compensation payment), therefore, needs to be examined. The cause of low-frequency hearing loss cannot be established audiometrically. It must be studied on an empirical basis. More than 400 000 examinations to which noise-surrounded workers were subjected are available for this purpose. They make it possible that many observations can be made of how the defect develops and progresses in one single person. As can be seen, the above-mentioned hearing defect is caused mainly by previous damage, which is more frequently of an exogenous nature (commotio cerebri, fractures of the skull, acute noise traumata) than of an endogenous nature (e.g. meningitis).

A review of the vascular anatomy of the inner ear makes it clear that many clinically observed audiometric patterns and associated partial vestibular deficits in idiopathic sudden hearing loss cannot be explained by assigning a site of presumed vascular occlusion. We investigated 166 pure tone audiograms of patients with idiopathic sudden hearing loss by using the statistical method of cluster analysis, which allow an explanation based on the vascular anatomy. Three types of audiograms could be found which differed not in shape but in the degree of hearing loss. None of them can be explained by the vascular anatomy. The three groups of audiograms with different degrees of hearing loss allowed investigations of the influence of age, sex, vestibular disturbance and vascular disease. Men are more often affected, the degree of the hearing loss is not dependent on age, vestibular disturbance, vascular disease, diabetes or smoking.

The aim of the present work was to study certain aspects of the functional development of the auditory cortex in adult cats unilaterally deaf from birth. In adult animals reared with a neonatal cochlear ablation, field AI ipsilateral to the non-operated ear showed a normal tonotopic map, which was derived from single neurons and neuron clusters driven securely by best-frequency tonal stimulation in virtually every electrode penetration. The acoustic thresholds at many recording sites were as low as those obtained in AI contralateral to the non-operated ear. These findings are in marked contrast to those from control experiments on normal adult cats where only about 65% of AI neurons were excited by a sound delivered to the ipsilateral ear and where thresholds to ipsilateral ear stimulation were significantly higher than contralateral thresholds. The spatial distribution of cortical neurons based on acoustic thresholds also appeared to be different in cats unilaterally deaf from birth when compared to control cats. Closely spaced electrode penetrations in AI ipsilateral to the non-operated ear suggested that neurons were separated into low-threshold regions and high-threshold regions. There was no evidence for this type of non-random segregation in control experiments.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed3&AN=17777511,SFX,3620992 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3620992]

Frequency resolution was derived from masking with comb-filtered noise and from the psychophysical tuning curve, for both paradigms in simultaneous and in nonsimultaneous masking. The critical ratio was also determined. Temporal resolution was determined with intensity-modulated noise and from backward and forward masking. All tests were performed at 1000 Hz. Correlations among tests were gathered in a matrix and subjected to a principal-components analysis. It turned out that tests on frequency resolution form a cluster, and are approximately independent of audiometric loss. Furthermore, hearing loss for speech in noise is closely allied to frequency resolution, whereas hearing loss for speech in quiet is governed by audiometric loss.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed3&AN=13131034,SFX,6841805 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6841805]

Forquer B.D.",,"(Belal Jr., Forquer) Alexandria Med. Sch., Alexandria Egypt",,"Static compliance, height of tympanogram, and slope of tympanogram were analyzed in ten temporal bone preparations after experiments simulating a number of middle ear disorders, including middle ear effusion, ossicular fixation, ossicular disarticulation, tympanic membrane perforation, and dual ossicular lesions. Each measure was analyzed separately and in combination with each other measure. No measure alone was of value in differentiating the site of a lesion in the middle ear, although tympanogram height could easily distinguish middle ear effusion from ossicular discontinuity. The combination of static compliance and height of tympanogram yielded the greatest diagnostic sensitivity. Shown are four clusters of lesions that can be differentiated when both static compliance and height of tympanogram are considered together. Area I, demonstrating low compliance and low tympanogram height, which would be considered Jerger type B tympanograms, included three cases of thick effusion and one case each of fixation of the incus to the epitympanum, fixation of the stapedius tendon, and perforation of the tympanic membrane. The perforation case could, of course, be clearly differentiated from the effusion cases by its extremely large C2 value. Area II, showing type A(s) tympanograms, is an interesting cluster of ossicular fixations, including incudo-malleal fixation, incudo-stapedial fixation, stapes footplate fixation, true otosclerosis, and two cases of thin fluid. Although interpretation of tympanometric data could not differentiate the site of the lesion in ossicular fixation, they were clearly clustered together in a particular region. Area III, designated the normal area, included all cases of bones without any lesion and two cases of thin fluid. Finally area IV, demonstrating Jerger type A(d) tympanograms and very high static compliance, contains three cases of incus removal, a case of a sectioned malleus neck, and a case of disarticulated incudo-stapedial joint. Tympanometry alone, then, has only limited value if differentiating the various elements of conductive hearing loss. While it is possible to differentiate ossicular fixation from ossicular discontinuity and middle ear effusion, specific indentification of the site of the lesion seems to be impossible and only gross categorization is possible. Of special difficulty was the differentiation of some of the milder fixations and disarticulations (as in fixing the stapedius tendon) and thin fluid from normal tympanograms. It would be expected, of course, that the addition of reflex data might increase the differentiating potential of tympanometry. Considering, however, that even minimal (5-10 dB) conductive losses are known to abolish the acoustic reflex clinically, impedance audiometry can not be considered more than grossly sensitive to the site of a lesion in the middle ear. Tympanometry, when interpreted in conjunction with the case history, otoscopy, audiometric studies and X-ray data, can be a valuable source of information on the acoustic characteristics of the middle ear system.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed3&AN=10045184,SFX,6776207 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6776207]
