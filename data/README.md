# Overview of data for the systematic review
## Structure
The repo contains data from:

1. The articles returned by the search terms (i.e., raw data); (`./search_returns/`)
2. The pre-processed title-abstract (tiab) data ready for manual reviewing (i.e., deduplicated dataset); (`./tiab/`)
3. The responses of the reviewers for each stage of the review (`./responses/`)
4. The completed APPRAISE-AI assessments by reviewers (`./appraise-ai/`)

For any queries on the notebooks or issues please add an issue to the current repo or, contact Liam Barrett ([l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk](l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk))
