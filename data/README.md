# Overview of data for the systematic review
## Structure
The repo contains data from:

1. The articles returned by the search terms (i.e., raw data)
2. The pre-processed data ready for manual reviewing (i.e., deduplicated dataset)
3. The responses of the reviewers for each stage of the review

For any queries on the notebooks or issues please add an issue to the current repo or, contact Liam Barrett ([l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk](l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk))
