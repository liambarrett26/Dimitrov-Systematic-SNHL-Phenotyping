Reference lists of eligible studies and any other relevant systematic reviews will be screened manually. The search will be limited to the English language only.

†GitHub is used to allow for unpublished models to be included in the review ([Siddaway et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102803)).  
*These two resources are used to allow for a.) ‘Grey literature’ and b.) unpublished works to be included in the review ([Siddaway et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102803)).

We will need to add in specifiers for when the search was made to be able to reproduce the search. Although, these is nothing stopping the authors from deleting the repo's...

Something like `audiometric created:2020 created:2021 created:2022 created:2023 created:2024-01 created:2024-02 created:2024-03` would allow for data filtering.
