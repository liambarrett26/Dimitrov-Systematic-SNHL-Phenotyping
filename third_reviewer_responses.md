# Resolutions by 3rd reviewer
Document for reviewer 3 (Nish) to make final decision on disagreements between R1 (Lily) and R2 (Liam). There were 6 Title and abstracts that required R3’s final judgement.

The following includes:

- The inclusion/exclusion criteria for title-abstract screening,
- A table for R3’s responses and,
- The 6 title and abstracts to be screened

## Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
### Inclusion:
- The study should report a machine learning model. 
  - Unsupervised machine learning models are considered. We are interested in the generation of data-driven hearing loss subtypes using an unsupervised approach. 
  - The model should have hearing health data as input in the form of hearing test data. This encompasses a wide range of investigations including pure tone audiometry, EEG (including automated brainstem response), speech-in-noise testing, otoacoustic emissions.  
  - The model is built to identify data-driven hearing loss subtypes.  
- The study is concerned with sensorineural hearing loss only.  
- The study is concerned with adult participants only.  
- Original research articles, conference proceedings and will be included. 
- Only English-language results will be included. 
- Only studies published between 01/01/1990 and the date of the search.  
### Exclusion:
- Models for which do not explicitly utilise machine learning will be excluded. 
- Models for hearing loss recognition (e.g., otitis media, age-related hearing loss, etc.) that do not utilise audiometric data will be excluded. 
- Review articles and meta-analyses will be excluded. 
- Non-English language articles will be excluded.
