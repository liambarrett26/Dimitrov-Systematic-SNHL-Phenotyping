# Code notebooks for data extraction and pre-processing of systematic review
## Structure
The repo contains notebooks for:

1. De-duplication of original articles returned by searching databases
2. Title and abstract screening template
3. Inter-rater reliability calculations

The notebooks should be considered in the above order. All data required for these notebooks are available under `~/data` in the current repo.

For any queries on the notebooks or issues please add an issue to the current repo or, contact Liam Barrett ([l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk](l.barrett.16@ucl.ac.uk))
